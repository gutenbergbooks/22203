    <h2>
      INTRODUCTORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      When these essays were originally printed (they appeared simultaneously in
      many newspapers), I expected to make some enemies. So far, I have been
      most agreeably disappointed in that regard; but I can affirm that they
      have made me many friends, and that I have had encouragement enough from
      fellow craftsmen, from professional critics, and from casual readers at
      home, in the colonies, and the United States to bolster up the courage of
      the most timorous man that ever held a pen. As a set-off against all this,
      I have received one very noble and dignified rebuke from a Contemporary in
      Fiction, whom the world holds in high honour, who regrets that I am not
      engaged in creative work&mdash;in lieu of this&mdash;and pleads that
      &lsquo;authorship should be allowed the distinction of an exemption from rank
      and title.&rsquo; With genuine respect I venture to urge that this is an
      impossible aspiration, and in spite of the lofty sanction which the
      writer&rsquo;s name must lend to his opinion, I have been unable to surrender
      the belief that the work done in these pages is alike honourable and
      useful. It is, as will be seen, in the nature of a crusade against puffery
      and hysteria. It is not meant to instruct the instructed, and it makes no
      pretence to be infallible, but it is issued in its present form in the
      belief that it will (in some degree) aid the average reader in the
      formation of just opinions on contemporary art, and in the hope that it
      may (in some degree) impose a check on certain interested or
      over-enthusiastic people.

    <h2>
      I.&mdash;FIRST, THE CRITICS, AND THEN A WORD ON DICKENS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The critics of to-day are suffering from a sort of epidemic of kindness.
      They have accustomed themselves to the administration of praise in
      unmeasured doses. They are not, taking them in the mass, critics any
      longer, but merely professional admirers. They have ceased to be useful to
      the public, and are becoming dangerous to the interests of letters. In
      their over-friendly eyes every painstaking apprentice in the art of
      fiction is a master, and hysterical schoolgirls, who have spent their
      brief day in the acquisition of ignorance, are reviewed as if they were so
      many Elizabeth Barrett Brownings or George Eliots. One of the most curious
      and instructive things in this regard is the use which the modern critic
      makes of Sir Walter Scott. Sir Walter is set up as a sort of first
      standard for the aspirant in the art of fiction to excel. Let the question
      be asked, with as much gravity as is possible: What <i>is</i> the use of a
      critic who gravely assures us that Mr. S. R. Crockett &lsquo;has rivalled, if
      not surpassed, Sir Walter&rsquo;? The statement is, of course, most lamentably
      and ludicrously absurd, but it is made more than once, or twice, or
      thrice, and it is quoted and advertised. It is not Mr. Crockett&rsquo;s fault
      that he is set on this ridiculous eminence, and his name is not cited here
      with any grain of malice. He has his fellow-sufferers. Other gentlemen who
      have &lsquo;rivalled, if not surpassed, Sir Walter,&rsquo; are Dr. Conan Doyle, Mr. J.
      M. Barrie, Mr. Ian Maclaren, and Mr. Stanley Weyman. No person whose
      judgment is worth a straw can read the writings of these accomplished
      workmen without respect and pleasure. But it is no more true that they
      rival Sir Walter than it is true that they are twelve feet high, or that
      any one of them believes in his own private mind the egregious
      announcement of the reviewer. The one great sufferer by this craze for
      setting men of middling stature side by side with Scott is our beautiful
      and beloved Stevenson, who, unless rescued by some judicious hand, is
      likely to be buried under foolish and unmeasured praises.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be easy to fill pages with verifications of the charge here made.
      Books of the last half-dozen years or so, which have already proved the
      ephemeral nature of their own claim, have been received with plaudits
      which would have been exaggerated if applied to some of our acknowledged
      classics. The critical declaration that &lsquo;Eric Bright-eyes&rsquo; could have been
      written by no other Englishman of the last six hundred years than Mr.
      Rider Haggard may be allowed its own monumental place in the desert of
      silly and hysteric judgments.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is time, for the sake of mere common-sense, to get back to something
      like a real standard of excellence. It is time to say plainly that our
      literature is in danger of degradation, and that the mass of readers is
      systematically misled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I go further, I will offer one word in self-excuse. I have taken
      this work upon my own shoulders, because I cannot see that anybody else
      will take it, and because it seems to me to be calling loudly to be done.
      My one unwillingness to undertake it lies in the fact that I have devoted
      my own life to the pursuit of that art the exercise of which by my
      contemporaries I am now about to criticise. That has an evil and
      ungenerous look. But, whatever the declaration may seem to be worth, I
      make it with sincerity and truth. I have never tasted the gall of envy in
      my life. I have had my share, and my full share, of the critical
      sugarplums. I have never, in the critics, apprehension, &lsquo;rivalled or
      surpassed Sir Walter,&rsquo; but on many thousands of printed pages (of
      advertisement) it is recorded that I have &lsquo;more genius for the delineation
      of rustic character than any half-dozen surviving novelists put together.&rsquo; 
      I laugh when I read this, for I remember Thomas Hardy, who is my master
      far and far away. I am quite persuaded that my critic was genuinely
      pleased with the book over which he thus &lsquo;pyrotechnicated&rsquo; (as poor
      Artemus used to say), but I think my judgment the more sane and sober of
      the two. I have not the faintest desire to pull down other men&rsquo;s flags and
      leave my own flag flying. And there is the first and last intrusion of
      myself. I felt it necessary, and I will neither erase it nor apologise for
      its presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Side by side with the exaggerated admiration with which our professional
      censors greet the crowd of new-comers, it is instructive to note the
      contempt into which some of our old gods have fallen. The Superior Person
      we have always with us. He is, in his essence, a Prig; but when, as
      occasionally happens, his heart and intelligence ripen, he loses the
      characteristics which once made him a superior person. Whilst he holds his
      native status his special art is not to admire anything which common
      people find admirable. A year or two ago it became the shibboleth of his
      class that they couldn&rsquo;t read Dickens. We met suddenly a host of people
      who really couldn&rsquo;t stand Dickens. Most of them (of course) were &lsquo;the
      people of whom crowds are made,&rsquo; owning no sort of mental furniture worth
      exchange or purchase. They killed the fashion of despising Dickens <i>as</i>
      a fashion, and the Superior Person, finding that his sorrowful inability
      was no longer an exclusive thing, ceased to brag about it. When a fashion
      in dress is popular on Hampstead Heath on Bank Holiday festivals, the
      people who originally set the fashion discard it, and set another. In half
      a generation some of our superiors, for the mere sake of originality in
      judgment, will be going back to the pages of that immortal master-immortal
      as men count literary immortality&mdash;and will begin to tell us that
      after all there was really something in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. W. D. Howells, an American writer of distinguished ability, as
      times go, who set afloat the phrase that since the death of Thackeray and
      Dickens fiction has become a finer art. If Mr. Howells had meant what many
      people supposed him to mean, the saying would have been merely impudent He
      used the word &lsquo;finer&rsquo; in its literal sense, and meant only that a fashion
      of minuteness in investigation and in style had come upon us. There is a
      sense in which the dissector who makes a reticulation of the muscular and
      nervous systems of a little finger is a &lsquo;finer&rsquo; surgeon than the giant of
      the hospitals whose diagnosis is an inspiration, and whose knife carves
      unerringly to the root of disease. There is a sense in which a sculptor,
      carving on cherrystones likenesses of commonplace people, would be a
      &lsquo;finer&rsquo; artist than Michael Angelo, whose custom it was to handle forms of
      splendour on an heroic scale of size. In that sense, and in the hands of
      some of its practitioners, fiction for a year or two became a finer art
      than it had ever been before. But the microscopist was never popular, and
      could never hope to be. He is dead now, and the younger men are giving us
      vigorous copies of Dumas, and Scott, and Edgar Allan Poe, and some of them
      are fusing the methods of Dickens with those of later and earlier writers.
      We are in for an era of broad effect again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a great many people, and, amongst them, some who ought to have known
      better, adopted the saying of Mr. Howells in a wider sense than he ever
      intended it to carry, and, partly as a result of this, we have arrived at
      a certain tacit depreciation of the greatest emotional master of fiction.
      There are other and more cogent reasons for the temporary obscuration of
      that brilliant light. It may aid our present purpose to discover what they
      are.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every age has its fashions in literature as it has in dress. All the
      beautiful fashions in literature, at least, have been thought worthy of
      revival and imitation, but there has come to each in turn a moment when it
      has begun to pall upon the fancy. Every school before its death is fated
      to inspire satiety and weariness. The more overwhelming its success has
      been, the more complete and sweeping is the welcomed change. We know how
      the world thrilled and wept over Pamela and Clarissa, and we know how
      their particular form of pathos sated the world and died. We know what a
      turn enchanted castles had, and how their spell withered into nothing. We
      know what a triumphal progress the Sentimental Sufferer made through the
      world, and what a bore he came to be. It is success which kills. Success
      breeds imitation, and the imitators are a weariness. And it is not the
      genius who dies. It is only the school which arose to mimic him.
      Richardson is alive for everybody but the dull and stupid. Now that the
      world of fiction is no longer crowded with enchanted castles, we can go to
      live in one occasionally for a change, and enjoy ourselves. Werther is our
      friend again, though the school he founded was probably the most tiresome
      the world has seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, with the solitary exception of Sir Walter Scott, it is probable that
      no man ever inspired such a host of imitators as Charles Dickens. There is
      not a writer of fiction at this hour, in any land where fiction is a
      recognised trade or art, who is not, whether he knows it and owns it, or
      no, largely influenced by Dickens. His method has got into the atmosphere
      of fiction, as that of all really great writers must do, and we might as
      well swear to unmix our oxygen and hydrogen as to stand clear of his
      influences. To stand clear of those influences you must stand apart from
      all modern thought and sentiment. You must have read nothing that has been
      written in the last sixty years, and you must have been bred on a desert
      island. Dickens has a living part in the life of the whole wide world. He
      is on a hundred thousand magisterial benches every day. There is not a
      hospital patient in any country who has not at this minute a right to
      thank God that Dickens lived. What his blessed and bountiful hand has done
      for the poor and oppressed, and them that had no helper, no man knows. He
      made charity and good feeling a religion. Millions and millions of money
      have flowed from the coffers of the rich for the benefit of the poor
      because of his books. A great part of our daily life, and a good deal of
      the best of it, is of his making.
    </p>
    <p>
      No single man ever made such opportunities for himself. No single man was
      ever so widely and permanently useful. No single man ever sowed gentleness
      and mercy with so broad a sweep.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is all true, and very far from new, but it has not been the fashion
      to say it lately. It is not the whole of the truth. Noble rivers have
      their own natural defects of swamp and mudbank. Sometimes his tides ran
      sluggishly, as in &lsquo;The Battle of Life,&rsquo; for example, which has always
      seemed to me, at least, a most mawkish and unreal book. The pure stream of
      &lsquo;The Carol,&rsquo; which washes the heart of a man, runs thin in &lsquo;The Chimes,&rsquo; 
      runs thinner in &lsquo;The Haunted Man,&rsquo; and in &lsquo;The Battle of Life&rsquo; is lees and
      mud. &lsquo;Nickleby,&rsquo; again, is a young man&rsquo;s book, and as full of blemishes as
      of genius. But when all is said and done, it killed the Yorkshire schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief fault the superficial modern critic has to find with Dickens is
      a sort of rumbustious boisterousness in the expression of emotion. But let
      one thing be pointed out, and let me point it out in my own fashion. Tom
      Hood, who was a true poet, and the best of our English wits, and probably
      as good a judge of good work as any person now alive, went home after
      meeting with Dickens, and in a playful enthusiasm told his wife to cut off
      his hand and bottle it, because it had shaken hands with Boz. Lord
      Jeffrey, who was cold as a critic, cried over little Nell. So did Sydney
      Smith, who was very far from being a blubbering sentimentalist. To judge
      rightly of any kind of dish you must bring an appetite to it. Here is the
      famous Dickens pie, when first served, pronounced inimitable, not by a
      class or a clique, but by all men in all lands. But you get it served hot,
      and you get it served cold, it is rehashed in every literary restaurant,
      you detect its flavour in your morning leader and your weekly review. The
      pie gravy finds its way into the prose and the verse of a whole young
      generation. It has a striking flavour, an individual flavour, It gets into
      everything. We are weary of the ceaseless resurrections of that once so
      toothsome dish. Take it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original pie is no worse and no better, but thousands of cooks have
      had the recipe for it, and have tried to make it. Appetite may have
      vanished, but the pie was a good pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      No simile runs on all fours, and this parable in a pie-dish is a poor
      traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this principle of judgment applies of necessity to all great work in
      art. It does not apply to merely good work, for that is nearly always
      imitative, and therefore not much provocative of imitation. It happens
      sometimes that an imitator, to the undiscerning reader, may even seem
      better than the man he mimics, because he has a modern touch. But
      remember, in his time the master also was a modern.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new man says of Dickens that his sentiment rings false. This is a
      mistake. It rings old-fashioned. No false note ever moved a world, and the
      world combined to love his very name. There were tears in thousands of
      households when he died, and they were as sincere and as real as if they
      had arisen at the loss of a personal friend.

      We, who in spite of fashion remain true to our allegiance to the magician
      of our youth, who can never worship or love another as we loved and
      worshipped him, are quite contented in the slight inevitable dimming of
      his fame. He is still in the hearts of the people, and there he has only
      one rival.

      No attempt at a review of modern fiction can be made without a mention of
      the men who were greatest when the art was great When we have done with
      the giants we will come down to the big fellows, and by that time we shall
      have an eye for the proportions of the rest. But before we part for the
      time being, let me offer the uncritical reader one valuable touchstone.
      Let him recall the stories he has read, say, five years ago. If he can
      find a live man or woman anywhere amongst his memories, who is still as a
      friend or an enemy to him, he has, fifty to one, read a sterling book.
      Dickens&rsquo; people stand this test with all readers, whether they admire him
      or no. Even when they are grotesque they are alive. They live in the
      memory even of the careless like real people. And this is the one
      unfailing trial by which great fiction may be known.

    <h2>
      II.&mdash;CHARLES READE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Reade&rsquo;s position in literature is distinctly strange. The professional
      critics never came within miles of a just appreciation of his greatness,
      and the average &lsquo;cultured reader&rsquo; receives his name with a droll air of
      allowance and patronage. But there are some, and these are not the least
      qualified as judges, who regard him as ranking with the great masters. You
      will find, I think, that the men holding this opinion are, in the main,
      fellow-workers in the craft he practised. His warmest and most constant
      admirers are his brother novelists. Trollope, to be sure, spoke of him as
      &lsquo;almost a man of genius,&rsquo; but Trollope&rsquo;s mind was a quintessential
      distillation of the commonplace, and the man who was on fire with the
      romance and passion of his own age was outside the limit of his
      understanding. But amongst the writers of English fiction whom it has been
      my privilege to know personally, I have not met with one who has not
      reckoned Charles Reade a giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The critics have never acknowledged him, and, in a measure, he has been
      neglected by the public. There is a reason for everything, if we could
      only find it, and sometimes I seem to have a glimmering of light on this
      perplexing problem. Sir Walter Besant (Mr. Besant then) wrote in the
      &lsquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine&rsquo; years ago a daring panegyric on Reade&rsquo;s work,
      giving him frankly a place among the very greatest. My heart glowed as I
      read, but I know now that it took courage of the rarer sort to express a
      judgment so unreserved in favour of a writer who never for an hour
      occupied in the face of the public such a position as is held by three or
      four men in our day, whom this dead master could have rolled in the hollow
      of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me try for a minute or two to show why and how he is so very great a
      man; and then let me try to point out one or two of the reasons for which
      the true reward of greatness has been denied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very first essential to greatness in any pursuit is that a man should
      be in earnest in respect to it. You may as well try to kindle your
      household fire with pump water as to excite laughter by the invention of a
      story which does not seem laughable to yourself, or to draw real tears by
      a story conceived whilst your own heart is dry, &lsquo;The wounded is the
      wounding heart.&rsquo; In Charles Reade&rsquo;s case this essential sympathy amounted
      to a passion. He derided difficulties, but he derided them after the
      fashion of the thorough-going enthusiast, and not after that of the
      sluggard. He made up his mind to write fiction, and he practised for years
      before he printed a line. He assured himself of methods of selection and
      of forms of expression. Better equipped by nature than one in a hundred of
      those who follow the profession he had chosen he laboured with a fiery,
      unresting patience to complete his armoury, and to perfect himself in the
      handling of its every weapon. He read omnivorously, and, throughout his
      literary lifetime, he made it his business to collect and to collate, to
      classify and to catalogue, innumerable fragments of character, of history,
      of current news, of evanescent yet vital stuffs of all sorts. In the last
      year but one of his life he went with me over some of the stupendous
      volumes he had built in this way. The vast books remain as an illustration
      of his industry, but only one who has seen him in consultation with their
      pages can guess the accuracy and intimacy of his knowledge of their
      contents. They seem to deal with everything, and with whatever they
      enclosed he was familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      This encyclopaedic industry would have left a commonplace man commonplace,
      and in the estimate of a great man&rsquo;s genius it takes rank merely as a
      characteristic. His sympathy for his chosen craft was backed by a sympathy
      for humanity just as intense and impassioned. He was a glorious lover and
      hater of lovable and hateful things.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one respect he was almost unique amongst men, for he united a savage
      detestation of wrong with a most minute accuracy in his judgment of its
      extent and quality. He laboured in the investigation of the problems of
      his own age with the cold diligence of an antiquary. He came to a
      conclusion with the calm of a great judge. And when his cause was sure he
      threw himself upon it with an extraordinary and sustained energy. The rage
      of his advocacy is in surprising contrast with the patience exerted in
      building up his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reade had a poet&rsquo;s recognition for the greatness of his own time. He saw
      the epic nature of the events of his own hour, the epic character of the
      men who moulded those events. Hundreds of years hence, when federated
      Australia is thickly sown with great cities, and the island-continent has
      grown to its fulness of accomplished nationhood, and is grey in honour,
      Reade&rsquo;s nervous English, which may by that time have grown quaint, and
      only legible to learned eves, will preserve; the history of its
      beginnings. That part of His work, indeed, is purely and wholly epic in
      sentiment and discernment, however colloquial in form, and it is the sole
      example of its kind, since it was written by one who was contemporary with
      the events described.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reade was pretty constantly at war with his critics, but he fairly
      justified himself of the reviewer in his own day, and at this time the
      people who assailed him have something like a right to sleep in peace. In
      private life one of the most amiable of men, and distinguished for
      courtesy and kindness, he was a swash-buckler in controversy. He had a
      trick of being in the right which his opponents found displeasing, and he
      was sometimes cruel in his impatience of stupidity and wrong-headedness.
      Scarcely any continuance in folly could have inspired most men to the
      retorts he occasionally made. He wrote to one unfortunate: &lsquo;Sir,&mdash;You
      have ventured to contradict me on a question with regard to which I am
      profoundly learned, where you are ignorant as dirt.&rsquo; It was quite true,
      but another kind of man would have found another way of saying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That trick of being right came out with marked effect in the discussion
      which accompanied the issue of &lsquo;Hard Cash&rsquo; in &lsquo;All the Year Round,&rsquo; A
      practitioner in lunacy condemned one of the author&rsquo;s statements as a bald
      impossibility. Reade answered that the impossibility in question disguised
      itself as fact, and went through the hollow form of taking place on such
      and such a date in such and such a public court, and was recorded in such
      and such contemporary journals. Whenever he made a crusade against a
      public evil, as when he assailed the prison system, or the madhouse
      system, or the system of rattening in trades unions, his case was
      supported by huge collections of indexed fact, and in the fight which
      commonly followed he could appeal to unimpeachable records; but again and
      again the angry fervour of the advocate led people to forget or to
      distrust the judicial accuracy on which his case invariably rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all is said and done, his claim to immortality lies less in the books
      which deal with the splendours and the scandals of his own age than in
      that monument of learning, of humour, of pathos, and of narrative skill,
      &lsquo;The Cloister and the Hearth.&lsquo;* It is not too much to say of this book
      that, on its own lines, it is without a rival. To the reader it seems to
      be not less than the revival of a dead age. To assert dogmatically that
      the bygone people with whom it deals could not have been other than it
      paints them would be to pretend to a knowledge greater than the writer&rsquo;s
      own. But they are not the men and women with whom we are familiar in real
      life, and they are not the men and women with whom other writers of
      fiction have made us acquainted. Yet they are indubitably human and alive,
      and we doubt them no more than the people with whom we rub shoulders in
      the street. Dr. Conan Doyle once said to me what I thought a memorable
      thing about this book; To read it, he said, was &lsquo;like going through the
      Dark Ages with a dark lantern,&rsquo; It is so, indeed. You pass along the
      devious route from old Sevenbergen to mediaeval Rome, and wherever the
      narrative leads you, the searchlight flashes on everything, and out of the
      darkness and the dust and death of centuries life leaps at you. And I know
      nothing in English prose which for a noble and simple eloquence surpasses
      the opening and the closing paragraphs of this great work, nor&mdash;with
      some naïve and almost childish passages of humour omitted&mdash;a richer,
      terser, purer, or more perfect style than that of the whole narrative.
      Nowadays, the fashion in criticism has changed, and the feeblest duffer
      amongst us receives welcome ten times more enthusiastic and praise less
      measured than was bestowed upon &lsquo;The Cloister and the Hearth&rsquo; when it
      first saw the light. Think only for a moment&mdash;think what would happen
      if such a book should suddenly be launched upon us. Honestly, there <i>could</i>
      be no reviewing it. Our superlatives have been used so often to describe,
      at the best, good, plain, sound work, and, at the worst, frank rubbish,
      that we have no vocabulary for excellence of such a cast.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It is worth while to record here a phrase used by Charles
     Reade to me in reference to this work. He was rebutting the
     charge of plagiarism which had been brought against him, and
     he said laughingly,  &lsquo;It is true that I milked three hundred
     cows into my bucket, but the butter I churned was my own.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      And now, how comes it that with genius, scholarship, and style, with
      laughter and terror and tears at his order, this great writer halts in his
      stride towards the place which should be his by right? It seems to me at
      times as if I had a partial answer to that question. I believe that a
      judicious editor, without a solitary act of impiety, could give Charles
      Reade undisputed and indisputable rank. One-half the whole business is a
      question of printing. This great and admirable writer had one constant
      fault, which is so vulgar and trivial that it remains as much of a wonder
      as it is of an offence. He seeks emphasis by the expedient of big type and
      small type, of capitals and small capitals, of italics and black letter,
      and of tawdry little illustrations. Long before the reader arrives at the
      point at which it is intended that his emotions shall be stirred, his eye
      warns him that the shock is coming. He knows beforehand that the
      rhetorical bolt is to fall just there, and when it comes it is ten to one
      that he finds the effect disappointing. Or the change from the uniformity
      of the page draws his eye to the &lsquo;displayed&rsquo; passages, and he is
      tantalised into reading them out of their proper place and order. Take,
      for instance, an example which just occurs to me. In &lsquo;It is Never Too Late
      to Mend,&rsquo; Fielding and Robinson are lost in an Australian forest&mdash;&lsquo;bushed,&rsquo; 
      as the local phrase goes. At that hour they are being hunted for their
      lives. They fall into a sort of devil&rsquo;s circle, and, as lost men have
      often done, they come in the course of their wanderings upon their own
      trail. For awhile they follow it in the hope that it will lead them to
      some camp or settlement. Suddenly Fielding becomes aware that they are
      following the track of their own earlier footprints, and almost in the
      same breath he discovers that these are joined by the traces of other
      feet. He reads a fatal and true meaning into this sign, looks to his
      weapons, and starts off at a mended pace. &lsquo;What are you doing?&rsquo; asks
      Robinson, and Fielding answers (in capital letters): &lsquo;I am hunting the
      hunters!&rsquo; The situation is admirably dramatic. Chance has so ordered it
      that the pursued are actually behind the pursuers, and the presence of the
      intended murderers is proclaimed by a device which is at once simple,
      natural, novel, and surprising. All the elements for success in thrilling
      narrative are here, and the style never lulls for a second, or for a
      second allows the strain of the position to relax. But those capital
      letters have long since called the eye of the reader to themselves, and
      the point the writer tries to emphasise is doubly lost. It has been
      forestalled, and has become an irritation. You come on it twice; you have
      been robbed of anticipation and suspense, which, just here, are the life
      and soul of art. You know before you ought to be allowed to guess; and,
      worst of all, perhaps, you feel that your own intelligence has been
      affronted. Surely you had imagination enough to feel the significance of
      the line without this meretricious trick to aid you. It is not the
      business of a great master in fiction to jog the elbow of the
      unimaginative, and to say, &lsquo;Wake up at this,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Here it is your duty to
      the narrative to experience a thrill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another and an equally characteristic fault, though of far less frequent
      occurrence, is Reade&rsquo;s fashion of intruding himself upon his reader. He
      stands, in a curiously irritating way, between the picture he has painted
      and the man he has invited to look at it. In one instance he drags the eye
      down to a footnote in order that you may read: &lsquo;I, C. R., say this&rsquo;&mdash;which
      is very little more or less than an impertinence. The sense of humour
      which probably twinkled in the writer&rsquo;s mind is faint at the best. We know
      that he, C. R., said that. We are giving of our time and intelligence to
      C. R., and we are rather sorry than otherwise to find him indulging in
      this small buffoonery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should, I think, be an instruction to future publishers of Charles
      Reade to give him Christian printing&mdash;to confine him in the body of
      his narrative to one fount of type, and rigorously to deny him the use
      (except in their accustomed and orthodox places) of capitals, small
      capitals, and italics. And I cannot think that any irreverence could be
      charged against an editor who had the courage to put a moist pen through
      those expressions of egotism and naive self-satisfaction and vanity which
      do occasionally disfigure his pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ask myself if these trifles&mdash;for in comparison with the sum of
      Reade&rsquo;s genius they are small things indeed&mdash;can in any reasonable
      measure account for the neglect which undoubtedly besets him. In narrative
      vigour he has but one rival&mdash;Dumas <i>père</i>&mdash;and he is far
      and away the master of that rival in everything but energy. No male writer
      surpasses him in the knowledge of feminine human nature. There is no
      love-making in literature to beat the story of the courtship of Julia Dodd
      and Alfred Hardy in &lsquo;Hard Cash.&rsquo; In mere descriptive power he ranks with
      the giants. Witness the mill on fire in &lsquo;The Cloister and the Hearth&rsquo;; the
      lark in exile in &lsquo;Never too Late to Mend&rsquo;; the boat-race in &lsquo;Hard Cash&rsquo;;
      the scene of Kate Peyton at the firelit window, and Griffith in the snow,
      in &lsquo;Griffith Gaunt.&rsquo; There are a thousand bursts of laughter in his pages,
      not mere sniggers, but lung-shaking laughters, and the man who can go by
      any one of a hundred pathetic passages without tears is a man to be
      pitied. Let it be admitted that at times he wrenches his English rather
      fiercely, and yet let it be said that for delicacy, strength, sincerity,
      clarity, and all great graces of style, he is side by side with the
      noblest of our prose writers. Can it be that a few scattered drops of
      vulgarity in emphasis dim such a fire as this? Does so small a dead fly
      taint so big a pot of ointment? I will not be foolish enough to dogmatise
      on such a point, and yet I can find no other reasons than those I have
      already given why a master-craftsman should not hold a master-craftsman&rsquo;s
      place. Solomon has told us what &lsquo;a little folly&rsquo; can do for him who is in
      reputation for wisdom.&rsquo; The great mass of the public can always tell what
      pleases it, but it cannot always tell why it is pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the man who writes for wide and lasting fame has to depend, not upon
      the verdict of the expert and the cultured, but on the love of those who
      only know they love, and who have no power to give the critical why and
      wherefore. The public&mdash;&lsquo;the stupid and ignorant pig of a public,&rsquo; as
      &lsquo;Pococurante&rsquo; called it years ago&mdash;is always being abused, and yet it
      is only the public which, in the end, can tell us if we have done well or
      ill. We have all to consent to be measured by it, and, in the long run, it
      estimates our stature with a perfect accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope I may not be thought impertinent in intruding here a reminiscence
      of Reade which seems characteristic of his sweeter side. In reading over
      these pages for the press I have been moved to a mournful and tender
      remembrance of the only one of the three great Vanished Masters whom it
      was my happy chance to meet in the flesh. I dedicated to him the second
      novel which left my pen&mdash;the third to reach the public&mdash;and in
      sending him the volumes on the day of issue I wrote what I remember as a
      rather boyish letter, in which I was at no pains to disguise my admiration
      for his genius. That admiration was not then tempered by the
      considerations which are expressed above, for they touched me only after
      many years of practice in the art he adorned so richly. He answered with a
      gentle and sad courtesy, and concluded with these words: &lsquo;It is no
      discredit in a young man to esteem a senior beyond his merits.&rsquo; I have
      always thought that very graceful and felicitous, and now that I am myself
      grown to be a senior I am more persuaded of its charm than ever.

    <h2>
      III.&mdash;ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the scheme of this series, as originally-announced, Thackeray&rsquo;s work
      should have formed the subject of the third chapter. But, on reflection, I
      have decided that, considering my present purpose, it would be little more
      than a useless self-indulgence to do what I at first intended. There is no
      sort of dispute about Thackeray. There is no need for any revision of the
      general opinion concerning him. It would be to me, personally, a
      delightful thing to write such an appreciation as I had in mind, but this
      is not the place for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us pass, then, at once to the consideration of the incomplete and
      arrested labours of the charming and accomplished workman whose loss all
      lovers of English literature are still lamenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have special and private reasons for thinking warmly of Robert Louis
      Stevenson, the man; and these reasons seem to give me some added warrant
      for an attempt to do justice to Robert Louis Stevenson, the writer. With
      the solitary exception of the unfortunate cancelled letters from Samoa,
      which were written whilst he was in ill-health, and suffered a complete
      momentary eclipse of style, he has scarcely published a line which may not
      afford the most captious reader pleasure. With that sole exception he was
      always an artist in his work, and always showed himself alive to the
      fingertips. He was in constant conscious search of felicities in
      expression, and his taste was exquisitely just. His discernment in the use
      of words kept equal pace with his invention&mdash;he knew at once how to
      be fastidious and daring. It is to be doubted if any writer has laboured
      with more constancy to enrich and harden the texture of his style, and at
      the last a page of his was like cloth of gold for purity and solidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the praise which the future critics of English literature will
      award him. But in this age of critical hysteria it is not enough to yield
      a man the palm for his own qualities. With regard to Stevenson our
      professional guides have gone fairly demented, and it is worth while to
      make an effort to give him the place he has honestly earned, before the
      inevitable reaction sets in, and unmerited laudations have brought about
      an unmerited neglect. His life was arduous. His meagre physical means and
      his fervent spirit were pathetically ill-mated. It was impossible to
      survey his career without a sympathy which trembled from admiration to
      pity. Certain, in spite of all precaution, to die young, and in the face
      of that stern fact genially and unconquerably brave, he extorted love. Let
      the whole virtue of this truth be acknowledged, and let it stand in excuse
      for praises which have been carried beyond the limits of absurdity. It is
      hard to exercise a sober judgment where the emotions are brought strongly
      into play. The inevitable tragedy of Stevenson&rsquo;s fate, the unescapable
      assurance that he would not live to do all which such a spirit in a
      sounder frame would have done for an art he loved so fondly, the magnetism
      of his friendship, his downright incapacity for envy, his genuine humility
      with regard to his own work and reputation, his unboastful and untiring
      courage, made a profound impression upon many of his contemporaries. It
      is, perhaps, small wonder if critical opinion were in part moulded by such
      influences as these. Errors of judgment thus induced are easily condoned.
      They are at least a million times more respectable than the mendacities of
      the publisher&rsquo;s tout, or the mutual ecstasies of the rollers of logs and
      the grinders of axes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curious ease with which, nowadays, every puny whipster gets the sword
      of Sir Walter has already been remarked. If any Tom o&rsquo; Bedlam chooses to
      tell the world that all the New Scottish novelists are Sir Walter&rsquo;s
      masters, what does it matter to anybody? It is shamelessly silly and
      impertinent, of course, and it brings newspaper criticism into contempt,
      but there is an end of it. If the writers who are thus made ridiculous
      choose to pluck the straws out of their critics&rsquo; hair and stick them in
      their own, they are poorer creatures than I take them for. The thing makes
      us laugh, or makes us mourn, just as it happens to hit our humour; but it
      really matters very little. It establishes one of two things&mdash;the
      critic is hopelessly incapable or hopelessly dishonest. The dilemma is
      absolute. The peccant gentleman may choose his horn, and no honest and
      capable reader cares one copper which he takes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with regard to Stevenson the case is very different. Stevenson has
      made a bid for lasting fame. He is formally entered in the list of
      starters for the great prize of literary immortality. No man alive can say
      with certainty whether he will get it. Every forced eulogy handicaps his
      chances. Every exaggeration of his merits will tend to obscure them. The
      pendulum of taste is remorseless. Swing it too far on one side, it will
      swing itself too far on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his case it has unfortunately become a critical fashion to set him side
      by side with the greatest master of narrative fiction the world has ever
      seen. In the interests of a true artist, whom this abuse of praise will
      greatly injure if it be persisted in, it will be well to endeavour soberly
      and quietly to measure the man, and to arrive at some approximate estimate
      of his stature.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be assumed that the least conscientious and instructed of our
      professional guides has read something of the history of Sir Walter Scott,
      and is, if dimly, aware of the effect he produced in the realm of
      literature in his lifetime. Sir Walter (who is surpassed or equalled by
      six writers of our own day, in the judgment of those astounding gentlemen
      who periodically tell us what we ought to think) was the founder of three
      great schools. He founded the school of romantic mediaeval poetry; he
      founded the school of antiquarian romance; and he founded the school of
      Scottish-character romance. He did odds and ends of literary work, such as
      the compilation and annotation of &lsquo;The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border,&rsquo; 
      and the notes to the poems and the Waverley Series. These were sparks from
      his great stithy, but a man of industry and talent might have shown them
      proudly as a lifetime&rsquo;s labour. The great men in literature are the epoch
      makers, and Sir Walter is the only man in the literary history of the
      world who was an epoch maker in more than one direction. It is the fashion
      to-day to decry him as a poet. There are critics who, setting a high value
      on the verse of Wordsworth or of Browning, for example, cannot concede the
      name of poetry to any modern work which is not subtle and profound,
      metaphysical or analytical. But as a mere narrative poet few men whose
      judgment is of value will deny Scott the next place to Homer. As a poet he
      created an epoch. It filled no great space in point of time, but we owe to
      Sir Walter&rsquo;s impetus &lsquo;he Giaour,&rsquo; &lsquo;he Corsair,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Bride of Abydos.&rsquo; In
      his second character of antiquarian romancist, he awoke the elder Dumas,
      and such a host of imitators, big and little, as no writer ever had at his
      heels before or since. When he turned to Scottish character he made Galt,
      and Robert Louis Stevenson, and Dr. George Macdonald, and all the modern
      gentlemen who, gleaning modestly in the vast field he found, and broke,
      and sowed, and reaped, are now his rivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do the writers who claim to guide our opinions read Scott at all? Do they
      know the scene of the hidden and revealed forces in the Trossach glen&mdash;the
      carriage of the Fiery Cross&mdash;the sentence on the erring nun &mdash;the
      last fight of her betrayer? Do they know the story of Jeannie Deans? But
      it is useless to ask these questions or to multiply these instances. Scott
      is placed. Master of laughter, master of tears, giant of swiftness;
      crowned king, without one all-round rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of those astonishing and yet natural things which sometimes startle us
      is the value some minds attach to mere modernity in art. An old thing is
      tossed up in a new way, and there are those who attach more value to the
      way than the thing, and are instantly agape with admiration of
      originality. But originality and modishness are different things. People
      who have a right to guide public opinion discern the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The absurd and damaging comparison between Scott and Stevenson has been
      gravely offered by the latter&rsquo;s friends. They are doing a beautiful artist
      a serious injustice, You could place Stevenson&rsquo;s ravishing assortment of
      cameos in any chamber of Scott&rsquo;s feudal castle. It is an intaglio beside a
      cathedral, a humming-bird beside an eagle. It is anything exquisite beside
      anything nobly huge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let any man, who may be strongly of opinion that I am mistaken, conceive
      Scott and Stevenson living in the same age and working in complete
      ignorance of each other. Scott would still have set the world on fire.
      Stevenson with his deft, swift, adaptive spirit, and his not easily
      over-praised perfection in his craft, would have still done something; but
      he would have missed his loftiest inspiration, his style would have been
      far other than it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a bit of pure literary enjoyment there are not many things better than
      to turn from Stevenson&rsquo;s more recent pages to Scott&rsquo;s letters in
      Lockhart&rsquo;s &lsquo;Life,&rsquo; and to see where the modern found the staple of his
      best and latest style.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comparison, which has been urged so often, will not stand a moment&rsquo;s
      examination. Stevenson is not a great creative artist. He is not an epoch
      maker. He cannot be set shoulder to shoulder with any of the giants. It is
      no defect in him which prompts this protest. Except in the sense in which
      his example of purity, delicacy, and finish in verbal work will inspire
      other artists, Stevenson will have no imitators, as original men always
      have. He has &lsquo;done delicious things,&rsquo; but he has done nothing new. He has
      with astonishing labour and felicity built a composite style out of the
      style of every good writer of English. Even in a single page he sometimes
      reflected many manners. He is the embodiment of the literary as
      distinguished from the originating intellect. His method is almost
      perfect, but it is devoid of personality. He says countless things which
      are the very echo of Sir Walter&rsquo;s epistolary manner. He says things like
      Lamb, and sometimes they are as good as the original could have made them.
      He says things like Defoe, like Montaigne, like Rochefoucauld.
    </p>
    <p>
      His bouquet is culled in every garden, and set in leaves which have grown
      in all forests of literature. He is deft, apt, sprightly, and always
      sincerely a man. He is just and brave, and essentially a gentleman. He has
      the right imitative romance, and he can so blend Defoe and Dickens with a
      something of himself which is almost, but not quite, creative, that he can
      present you with a blind old Pugh or a John Silver. He is a <i>littérateur</i>
      born&mdash;and made. A verbal invention is meat and drink to him. There
      are places where you see him actively in pursuit of one, as when Markheim
      stops the clock with &lsquo;an interjected finger,&rsquo; or when John Silver&rsquo;s
      half-shut, cunning, and cruel eye sparkles &lsquo;like a crumb of glass.&rsquo; 
      Stevenson has run across the Channel for that crumb, and it is worth the
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stevenson certainly had that share of genius which belongs to the man who
      can take infinite pains. Add to this a beautiful personal character, and
      an almost perfect receptivity. Add again the power of sympathetic
      realisation in a purely literary sense, and you have the man. Let me make
      my last addition clear. It is a common habit of his to think as his
      literary favourites would have thought He could think like Lamb. He could
      think like Defoe. He could even fuse two minds in this way, and make, as
      it were, a composite mind for himself to think with. His intellect was of
      a very rare and delicate sort, and whilst he was essentially a reproducer,
      he was in no sense an imitator, or even for a single second a plagiarist.
      He had an alembic of his own which made old things new. His best
      possession was that very real sense of proportion which was at the root of
      all his humour. &lsquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t God explain these things to a gentleman like
      me?&rsquo; There, a profound habitual reverence of mind suddenly encounters with
      a ludicrous perception of his own momentary self-importance. The two
      electric opposites meet, and emit that flash of summer lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stevenson gave rare honour to his work, and the artist who shows his
      self-respect in that best of ways will always be respected by the world.
      He has fairly won our affection and esteem, and we give them ungrudgingly.
      In seeming to belittle him I have taken an ungrateful piece of work in
      hand. But in the long run a moderately just estimate of a good man&rsquo;s work
      is of more service to his reputation than a strained laudation can be. It
      is not the critics, and it is not I, who will finally measure his
      proportions. He seems to me to stand well in the middle of the middle rank
      of accepted writers. He will not live as an inventor, for he has not
      invented. He will not live as one of those who have opened new fields of
      thought. He will not live amongst those who have explored the heights and
      the deeps of the spirit of man. He may live&mdash;&lsquo;the stupid and ignorant
      pig of a public&rsquo; will settle the question&mdash;as a writer in whose works
      stand revealed a lovable, sincere, and brave soul and an unsleeping
      vigilance of artistic effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most beautiful thing he has done&mdash;to my mind&mdash;is his
      epitaph. There are but eight lines of it, but I know nothing finer in its
      way:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Under the wide and starry sky
        Lay me down and let me lie.
     Glad did I live and gladly die,
        And I laid me down with a will!

     This be the verse you grave for me:
        Here he lies where he longed to be:
     Home is the Sailor, home from sea,
        And the Hunter home from the hill.
</pre>
    <p>
      Sleep there, bright heart! In your waking hours you would have laughed at
      the exaggerated praises which do you such poor service now!

      IV.&mdash;LIVING MASTERS&mdash;MEREDITH AND HALL CAINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is a very old story to the effect that a party of gentlemen who were
      compiling a dictionary described a crab as &lsquo;a small red animal which walks
      backwards.&rsquo; Apart from the facts that the crab is not red, is not an
      animal, and does not walk backwards, the definition was pronounced to be
      wholly admirable. I was reminded of this bit of ancient history when, some
      time ago, I read a criticism on George Meredith from the pen of Mr. George
      Moore. Mr. Moore represented his subject as a shouting, gesticulating man
      in a crowd, who, in spite of great efforts to be heard, remained
      unintelligible. As a description of a curiously calm sage who soliloquises
      for his own amusement in a study this is perfect. The enormous growth in
      the number of unthinking readers, and the corresponding increase in our
      printed output, have brought about some singular conditions, and, amongst
      them, this: that it is possible to sustain a reputation by the mere act of
      being absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      In attempting anything like a just review of the influence of the critical
      press in recent years, one has to admit that in its treatment of George
      Meredith it has performed a very considerable and praiseworthy public
      service. For many years Meredith worked in obscurity so far as the general
      public were concerned. Here and there he won an impassioned admirer, and
      from his beginning it may be said that he found audience fit though few;
      but he owes much of the present extent of his reputation to the efforts of
      generous and enlightened critics, who would not let the public rest until
      they had at least given his genius a hearing. He is now, and has for some
      time been, a fashionable cult. It is not likely that in the broad sense he
      will ever be a popular writer, for the mass of novel-readers are an idle
      and pleasure-loving folk, and no mere idler and pleasure-seeker will read
      Meredith often or read him long at a time. The little book which the angel
      gave to John of Patmos, commanding that he should eat it, was like honey
      in the mouth, but in the belly it was bitter. To the reader who first
      approaches him, a book of Meredith&rsquo;s offers an accurate contrast to the
      roll presented by the angel. It is tough chewing, but in digestion most
      suave and fortifying. The people who instantly enjoy him, who relish him
      at first bite, are rare. Fine intelligences are always rare. Personally, I
      am not one of the happy few. I am at my third reading of any one of
      Meredith&rsquo;s later books before I am wholly at my ease with it. I can find a
      most satisfying simile (to myself). A new book of Meredith&rsquo;s comes to me
      like a hamper of noble wines. I know the vintages, and I rejoice. I set to
      work to open the hamper. It is corded and wired in the most exasperating
      way, but at last I get it open. That is my first reading. Then I range my
      bottles in the cellar&mdash;port, burgundy, hock, champagne, imperial
      tokay; subtle and inspiring beverages, not grown in common vineyards, and
      demanding to be labelled. That is my second reading. Then I sit down to my
      wine, and that is my third; and in any book of Meredith&rsquo;s I have a
      cellarful for a lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      In view of a benefaction like this it becomes a man to be grateful, but
      for all that it is a pity that a great writer and a willing reader should
      be held apart by any avoidable hindrances. It is quite true that an
      immediate popularity is no test of high merit. But the real man of genius
      is, after all, he who permanently appeals to the widest public.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the middle-aged and the elderly fiction is a luxury. A story-book is
      like a pipe. It soothes and gratifies, and it helps an idle hour to pass.
      But younger people find actual food or actual poison where their elders
      find mere amusement. There are hundreds of thousands of young men and
      women who feel that they would like to have a clear outlook on things, who
      are searching more or less in earnest for a mental standing-place and
      point of view. If I had my way they should all be made to read Meredith,
      and the book at which I would start them should be &lsquo;The Shaving of
      Shagpat.&rsquo; It is in the nature of a handbook or guide to a young person of
      genius, it is true, and we can&rsquo;t all be persons of genius; but there is
      enough human nature in it to make it serviceable to all but the stupid. In
      the midst of its fantastic phantasmagoria there is a view of life so sane,
      so lofty, so feminine-tender, so masculine-strong, so piercing, keen and
      clear, that it is not easy to find an expression for admiration which
      shall be at once adequate and sober. On the mere surface it is almost as
      good as the &lsquo;Arabian Nights,&rsquo; and at the first flush of it you think that
      fancy is running riot. But when once the intention is grasped you find
      beneath that playful foam of seeming fun and frolic a very astonishing and
      deep philosophy, and the whole wild masquerade is filled with meaning.
      Read &lsquo;The Shaving of Shagpat,&rsquo; earnest young men and maidens. There is not
      much that is better for mere amusement in all the libraries, and if you
      care for the ripe conclusions of a scholar and a gentleman who knows the
      whole game of life better than any other man now living, you may find them
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I learn, on very good authority, that Meredith has but a poor comparative
      opinion of his earlier work, and that he would dissent rather strongly
      from the critic who pronounced &lsquo;The Ordeal of Richard Feverel&rsquo; his
      masterpiece. Yet it seems to me to be so, and in one particular it takes
      high rank indeed. It is remarkable that whilst love-making is so essential
      a part of the general human business, and whilst no novel or play which
      ignores it stands much chance of success, there are only two or three
      really virile presentations in fiction of &lsquo;the way of a man with a maid.&rsquo; 
      Shakspere gave us one in &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rsquo; but then Shakspere gave us
      everything. Charles Reade, in &lsquo;Hard Cash,&rsquo; has shown us a pure girl
      growing into pure passion&mdash;a bit of truth and beauty which alone
      might make a sterling and enduring name for him. And Meredith in &lsquo;Feverel&rsquo; 
      has given us scenes of young courtship which are beyond the praises of a
      writer like myself. The two young people on their magic island are amongst
      the real-ideal figures which haunt my mind with sweetness. Nature on
      either side is virginal. It flames and trembles with natural passion both
      in boy and girl, and they are as pure as a pair of daisies. Any workman in
      the school of Namby-Pamby could have kept their purity. Any writer of the
      Roman-candle-volcanic tribe could have heaped up their fires, after a
      fashion. But for this special piece of work God had first to make a
      gentleman, and then to give him genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      One peculiarity in Meredith is worthy of notice. He makes known to us the
      interior personality of his characters; he does this so completely that we
      are persuaded that we could predict their line of conduct in given
      circumstances; and then a set of circumstances occur in which they do
      something we should never have believed of them, and we have to confess
      that their maker is just and right, and that there is no disputing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are inconsistencies in his pages more glaring than anything we can
      imagine outside real life. The average artist, dealing with these
      manifestations, is a spectacle for pity, as the average man would be on
      Blondin&rsquo;s tight rope. The faintest deviation, the most momentary
      uncertainty of footing, a doubt, even, and it is all over. But Meredith
      never falters. He proves the impossible true by the mere fact of recording
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has no cranks or crazes or &lsquo;isms. He sees human nature with an eye
      which is at once broad and microscopic. What seem the very faults of style
      are virtues pushed to an extreme. He says more in a page than most men can
      say in a chapter. Modern science can put the nutritive properties of a
      whole ox into a very modest canister. Meredith&rsquo;s best sentences have gone
      through just such a digestive process. He is not for everybody&rsquo;s table,
      but he is a pride and a delight to the pick of English epicures.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Meredith to Hall Caine is from the study of the analyst to the
      foundry of the statuary; from art in cold calm to art in stormy fire.
      Here, too, is a force at work but it is strength at stress, and not at
      ease. Meredith is not very greatly moved. He sympathises, but he
      sympathises from the brain. His heart is right towards the world, but it
      is cool. The man we are now dealing with has a passionate sympathy. He is
      hot at heart, and he does not look on at the movement of mankind as merely
      understanding it, and analysing it, and liking it,&mdash;and making
      allowances for it. He is tumultuous and urgent, daring and impetuous,
      eager to say a great word. His conceptions shake him. They are all
      grandiose and huge. The great passions are awake in them&mdash;avarice,
      lust, hate, love, god-like pity, supreme courage, base fear. The whole
      trend of his mind is towards the heroic. He struggles to be in touch with
      the actual, and he makes many incursions upon it, but Romance snatches him
      away again, and claims him for her own. His native and ineradicable
      concept of a work of art in fiction is a story that shall shake the soul.
      This inborn passion for the vast and splendid in spiritual things is
      always in strict subordination to a moral purpose. Here is the reason for
      his hold upon the English-speaking people, which is probably, at this
      moment, deeper and wider than that of any other living writer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not deal in what I am now about to say with the critical adjustment
      of relative powers, but simply with a question of temperament You may draw
      a triangle, and at one of its extremes you may place Meredith, at another
      Stevenson, and at another Hall Caine. At one extremity you have an artist
      whose methods are almost purely intellectual, at the next you have an
      embodiment of sympathetic receptivity, and at the third a man whose forces
      are almost wholly emotional and dynamic. Stevenson&rsquo;s main literary
      prompting was to say a thing as well as it could possibly be said. Hall
      Caine&rsquo;s chief spur is a fiery impulse to a moral warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the earliest stages of Hall Caine&rsquo;s literary career until now his
      impulse has not changed, but he has made such a steady advance in
      craftsmanship as could not be made by any man who did not take his work in
      serious earnest. The faults of his first style still linger, but they are
      chastened. He has the defect of his quality. In each of his books he
      strives for an increasing stress of passion, a sustained crescendo; a full
      and steady breeze for the beginning, and then a gale, a tempest, a
      tornado. The story is always constructed with this view towards emotional
      growth and culmination. Sometimes he lets us see the effort this
      prodigious task imposes upon him, but in his later work more and more
      rarely. The natural temptation is towards a resonant and insistent
      eloquence, and he occasionally still forgets that he might, with ease to
      himself, profitably leave the catastrophe he has created to make its own
      impression. The artistic demand in the form of work to which his instinct
      draws him is heavier than in any other. It is simply to be white-hot in
      purpose and stone-cold in self-criticism at the same instant of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bar Meredith, who is quite <i>sui generis</i>, and Rudyard Kipling, whose
      characteristics will be dealt with later on, Hall Caine has less of the
      mark of his predecessors upon him than any of his contemporaries. His work
      has grown out of himself. He has had a word to speak, and he has spoken it
      So far he has increased in strength with every book, has grown more master
      of his own conceptions and himself. In &lsquo;A Son of Hagar&rsquo; he forced his
      story upon his reader in defiance of possibility; but no such blot on
      construction as the continued presence of a London cad in the person of a
      Cumberland man in the latter&rsquo;s native village has been seen in his more
      recent work. It is worth notice that even in this portion of his story the
      narrator shows no remotest sign of a disposition to crane at any of the
      numerous fences which lie before him. He takes them all in his stride, and
      the reader goes with him, willy-nilly, protesting perhaps, but helplessly
      whirled along in the author&rsquo;s grip. This faculty of daring is sometimes an
      essential to the story-teller&rsquo;s art, and Hall Caine has it in abundance,
      not merely in the occasional facing of improbabilities, but in that much
      loftier and more admirable form where it enables him to confront the
      cataclysmic emotions of the mind, and to carry to a legitimate conclusion
      scenes of tremendous conception and of no less tremendous difficulty. In
      the minds of vulgar and careless readers the defects which are hardest to
      separate from this form of art are so many added beauties, just as the
      over-emphasis of a tragic actor is the very thing which best appeals to
      the gallery. But Hall Caine does not address himself to the vulgar and the
      careless. He is eager to leave his reputation to his peers and to
      posterity. With every year of ripening power his capacity for
      self-restraint has grown. When it has come of age in him, there will be
      nothing but fair and well. There has been no man in his time who has shown
      a deeper reverence for his work, or a more consistent increase in his
      command of it. His method is large and noble, in accord with his design.
      He has given us the right to look to him for better and better and always
      better, and it is only in the direction indicated that he can mend.

    <h2>
      V.&mdash;LIVING MASTERS&mdash;RUDYARD KIPLING
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was &lsquo;up in the back blocks&rsquo; of Victoria when I lighted upon some stray
      copies of the weekly edition of the &lsquo;Melbourne Argus,&rsquo; and became aware of
      the fact that we had amongst us a new teller of stories, with a voice and
      a physiognomy of his own. The &lsquo;Argus&rsquo; had copied from some journal in
      far-away India a poem and a story, each unsigned, and each bearing
      evidence of the same hand. A year later I came back to England, and found
      everybody talking about &lsquo;The Man from Nowhere,&rsquo; who had just taken London
      by storm. Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s best work was not as yet before us, but there
      was no room for doubt as to the newcomer&rsquo;s quality, and the only question
      possible was as to whether he had come to stay. That inquiry has now been
      satisfactorily answered. The new man of half a dozen years ago is one of
      England&rsquo;s properties, and not the one of which she is least proud. About
      midway in his brief and brilliant career, counting from his emergence
      until now, people began to be afraid that he had emptied his sack. Partly
      because he had lost the spell of novelty, and partly because he did too
      much to be always at his best, there came a time when we thought we saw
      him sinking to a place with the ruck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sudden popularity carries with it many grave dangers, but the gravest of
      all is the temptation to produce careless and unripe work. To this
      temptation the new man succumbed, but only for awhile. Like the candid
      friend of Lady Clara Vere de Vere, he saw the snare, and he retired. But
      at the time when, instead of handing out the bread of life in generous
      slices, he took to giving us the sweepings of the basket I wrote a set of
      verses, which I called &lsquo;The Ballad of the Rudyard Kipling.&rsquo; I never
      printed it, because by the time it was fairly written.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kipling&rsquo;s work had not merely gone back to its first quality, but seemed
      brighter and finer than before, and the poor thing, such as it was, was in
      the nature of a satire. I venture to write down the opening verses here,
      since they express the feeling with which at least one writer of English
      fiction hailed his first appearance.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 I
 Oh, we be master mariners that sail the snorting seas,
 Right red-plucked mariners that dare the peril of the storm
 But we be old and worn and cold, and far from rest and ease,
 And only love and brotherhood can keep our tired hearts warm.

 II
 We were a noble company in days not long gone by,
 And mighty craft our elders sailed to every earthly shore.
 Men of worship, and dauntless soul, that feared nor sea nor sky;
 But God&rsquo;s hand stilled the valiant hearts, and the masters sail no more.

 III
 And for awhile, though we be brave and handy of our trade,
 We sailed no master-galleon, but wrought in cockboats all,
 Slight craft and manned with a single hand; yet many a trip we made,
 Though we but crept from port to port with cargoes scant and small.

 IV
 But on a day of wonder came ashining on the deep,
 A royal Splendour, proud with sail, and generous roar of guns;
 She passed us, and we gaped and stared.
 Her lofty bows were steep,
 And deep she rode the waters deep with a weight of countless tons.

 V
 Her rig was strange, her name unknown, she came we knew not whence,
 But on the flag at her peak we read &lsquo;The Drums of the Fore and Aft.&rsquo; 
 And&mdash;I speak for one&mdash;my breath came thick and my pulse beat hard and tense,
 And we cheered with tears of splendid joy at sight of the splendid craft.

 VI
 She swept us by; her master came and spoke us from the side;
 We knew our elder, though his beard was scarce yet fully grown;
 She spanked for home through churning foam with favouring wind and tide,
 And while we hailed like mad he sailed, a King, to take his own.
</pre>
    <p>
      Some men are born rich, and some are born lucky, and some are born both to
      luck and riches. Kipling is one of the last. Nature endowed him with
      uncommon qualities, and circumstances sent him into the sphere in which
      those qualities could be most fortunately exercised. It seems strange that
      the great store of treasure which he opened to us should have been
      unhandled and unknown so long. His Indian pictures came like a revelation.
      It is always so when a man of real genius dawns upon the world. It was so
      when Scott showed men and women the jewelled mines of romance which lay in
      the highways and byways of homely Scotland. It was so when Dickens bared
      the Cockney hearth to the sight of all men. Meg Merrilies, and Rob Roy,
      and Edie Ochiltree were all <i>there</i>&mdash;the wild, the romantic, the
      humorous were at the doors of millions of men before Scott saw them. In
      London, in the early days of Dickens, there were hordes of capable writers
      eager for something new. Not one of them saw Bob Cratchit, or Fagin, or
      the Marchioness until Dickens saw them. So, in India, the British Tommy
      had lived for many a year, and the jungle beasts were there, and
      Government House and its society were there, and capable men went up and
      down the land, sensible of its charm, its wonder, its remoteness from
      themselves, and yet not discerning truly. At last, when a thousand feet
      have trodden upon a thing of inestimable price, there comes along a
      newspaper man, doing the driest kind of hackwork, bound to a drudgery as
      stale and dreary as any in life, and he sees what no man has ever seen
      before him, though it has been plain in view for years and years. Through
      scorn and discouragement and contumely he polishes his treasure, in
      painful hours snatched from distasteful labour, and at last he brings it
      where it can be seen and known for what it is.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * I learn, on the very best authority, that Mr. Kipling
     regards his early and unrecognised days in India with much
     kindlier eyes than this would seem to indicate. It may be
     thought that, knowing this, I should amend or delete the
     passage. I let it stand, however, with this note as a
     qualification, because I think it possible that he, like the
     rest of us, looks on the past through tinted spectacles.
</pre>
    <p>
      It is only genius which owns the seeing eye. There are in Great Britain
      to-day a dozen writers of fine faculty, trained to observe, trained to
      give to observation its fullest artistic result; and they are all panting
      for something new. The something new is under their noses. They see it and
      touch it every day. If I could find it, my name in a year would sail over
      the seas, and I should be a great personage. But I shall not find it. None
      of the men who are now known will find it. It is always the unknown man
      who makes that sort of discovery. He will come in time, and when he comes
      we shall wonder and admire, and say: &lsquo;How new! How true!&rsquo; Why, in that
      very matter of Tommy Atkins, whose manifold portraits have done as much as
      anything to endear Kipling to the English people&mdash;it is known to many
      that in my own foolish youth I enlisted in the Army. I lived with Tommy. I
      fought and chaffed and drank and drilled and marched, and went &lsquo;up tahn&rsquo; 
      with him, and did pack drill, and had C.B. with him. I turned novel-writer
      afterwards, and never so much as dreamt of giving Tommy a place in my
      pages. Then comes Kipling, not knowing him one-half as well in one way,
      and knowing him a thousand times better in another way, and makes a noble
      and beautiful and merited reputation out of him; shows the man inside the
      military toggery, and makes us laugh and cry, and exult with feeling.
      There was a man in New South Wales&mdash;a shepherd&mdash;who went raving
      mad when he learnt that the heavy black dust which spoilt his pasture was
      tin, and that he had waked and slept for years without discovering the
      gigantic fortune which was all about him. I will not go mad, if I can help
      it, but I do think it rather hard lines on me that I hadn&rsquo;t the simple
      genius to see what lay in Tommy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good deal has been said of the occasional coarseness of Kipling&rsquo;s pages.
      There are readers who find it offensive, and they have every right to the
      expression of their feelings. I confess to having been startled once or
      twice, but never in a wholly disagreeable fashion&mdash;never as &lsquo;Jude the
      Obscure&rsquo; startled. Poor Captain Mayne Reid, who is still beloved by here
      and there a schoolboy, wrote a preface to one of his books&mdash;I think
      &lsquo;The Rifle Rangers,&rsquo; but it is years on years since I saw it&mdash;in
      order to put forth his defence for the introduction of an occasional oath
      or impious expletive in the conversation of his men of the prairies. He
      pleaded necessity. It was impossible to portray his men without it. And he
      argued that an oath does not soil the mind &lsquo;like the clinging immorality
      of an unchaste episode.&rsquo; The majority of Englishmen will agree with the
      gallant Captain. Kipling is rough at times, and daring, but he is always
      clean and honest. There are no hermaphroditic cravings after sexual
      excitement in him. He is too much of a man to care for that kind of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a benefactor an honest laughter-maker is! Since Dickens there has
      been nobody to fill our lungs like Kipling. Is it not better that the
      public should have &lsquo;My Lord the Elephant&rsquo; and &lsquo;Brugglesmith&rsquo; to laugh
      outright at than that they should be feebly sniggering over the jest-books
      begotten on English Dulness by Yankee humour, as they were eight or nine
      years ago? That jugful of Cockney sky-blue, with a feeble dash of Mark
      Twain in it, which was called &lsquo;Three Men in a Boat&rsquo; was not a cheerful
      tipple for a mental bank-holiday, but we poor moderns got no better till
      the coming of Kipling. We have a right to be grateful to the man who can
      make us laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing which strikes everybody who reads Kipling&mdash;and who does
      not?&mdash;is the truly astonishing range of his knowledge of
      technicalities. He is very often beyond me altogether, but I presume him
      to be accurate, because nobody finds him out, and that is a thing which
      specialists are so fond of doing that we may be sure they would have been
      about him in clouds if he had been vulnerable. He gives one the impression
      at times of being arrogant about this special fund of knowledge. But he
      nowhere cares to make his modesty conspicuous to the reader, and his
      cocksureness is only the obverse of his best literary virtue. It comes
      from the very crispness and definiteness with which he sees things. There
      are no clouds about the edges of his perceptions. They are all clear and
      <i>nette</i>, Things observed by such a man dogmatise to the mind, and it
      is natural that he should dogmatise as to what he sees with such apparent
      precision and completeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A recent writer, anonymous, but speaking from a respectable vehicle as
      platform, has told us that the short story is the highest form into which
      any expression of the art of fiction can be cast. This to me looks very
      like nonsense. I do not know any short story which can take rank with
      &lsquo;Père Goriot,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Vanity Fair,&rsquo; or &lsquo;David Copper-field.&rsquo; The short story
      has charms of its own, and makes demands of its own. What those demands
      are only the writers who have subjected themselves to its tyranny can
      know. The ordinary man who tries this form of art finds early that he is
      emptying his mental pockets. Kipling&rsquo;s riches in this respect have looked
      as if they were without end, and no man before him has paid away so much.
      But it has to be remembered here that in many examples of his power in
      this way he has been purely episodic, and the discovery or creation of an
      episode is a much simpler thing than the discovery or creation of a story
      proper, which is a collection of episodes, arranged in close sequence, and
      leading to a catastrophe, tragic or comic, as the theme may determine.
    </p>
    <p>
      In estimating the value of any writer&rsquo;s work you must take his range into
      consideration. Kipling stretches, in emotion, from deep seriousness to
      exuberant laughter; and his grasp of character is quite firm and sure,
      whether he deal with Mrs. Hawksbee or with Dinah Shadd; with a field
      officer or with Mulvaney, Ortheris, and Learoyd; with the Inspector of
      Forests or with Mowgli. He knows the ways of thinking of them all, and he
      knows the tricks of speech of all, and the outer garniture and daily
      habitudes of all. His mind seems furnished with an instantaneous camera
      and a phonographic recorder in combination; and keeping guard over this
      rare mental mechanism is a spirit of catholic affection and understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, he is an explorer, one of the original discoverers, one of the
      men who open new regions to our view. A revelation has waited for him. He
      is as much the master of his English compeers in originality as Stevenson
      was their master in finished craftsmanship.

    <h2>
      VI.&mdash;UNDER FRENCH ENCOURAGEMENT&mdash;THOMAS HARDY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Within the last half-score of years an extraordinary impulse towards
      freedom in the artistic representation of life has touched some of our
      English writers. Thackeray, in &lsquo;Pendennis,&rsquo; laments that since Fielding no
      English novelist has &lsquo;dared to draw a man.&rsquo; Dr. George Macdonald, in his
      &lsquo;Robert Falconer,&rsquo; whispers, in a sort of stage <i>aside</i>, his wish
      that it were possible to be both decent and honest in the exposition of
      the character of the Baron of Rothie, who is a seducer by profession.
      Perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of Thackeray was, that he
      was a gentleman, and that his good-breeding and his manliness were
      essentially of the English pattern. Dr. Mac-donald&rsquo;s most intense impulse
      is towards purity of life, as an integral necessity for that communion
      with the Eternal Fatherhood which he preaches with so much earnestness and
      charm. That two such men should have felt that their work was subject to a
      painful limitation on one side of it is significant, but it is a fact
      which may be used with equal force as an argument by the advocates of the
      old method and the adopters of the new. It is perfectly true that they
      felt the restriction, but it is equally true that they respected it, and
      were resolute not to break through it. Their cases are cited here, not as
      an aid to argument on one side or the other, but simply to show that the
      argument itself is no new thing&mdash;that the question as to how far
      freedom is allowable has been debated in the minds of honest writers, and
      decided in one way, long before it came to be debated by another set of
      honest writers, who decided it in another.
    </p>
    <p>
      There never was an age in which outspoken honesty was indecent. There
      never was an age in which pruriency in any guise could cease to be
      indecent. There never was an age when the fashion of outspoken honesty did
      not give a seeming excuse to pruriency; and it is this fact, that freedom
      in the artistic presentation of the sexual problems has invariably led to
      license, which has in many successive ages of literature forced the artist
      back to restraint, and has made him content to be bound by a rigid
      puritanism. In the beat of the eternal pendulum of taste it seems ordained
      that puritanism shall become so very puritanic that art shall grow tired
      of its bonds, and that liberty in turn shall grow offensive, and shall
      compel art by an overmastering instinct to return towards puritanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is France which has led the way in the latest protest against the
      restrictions imposed by modern taste upon art. It may be admitted as a
      fact that those restrictions were felt severely, for it is obvious that
      until they began to chafe there was no likelihood of their being violently
      broken. The chief apostle of the new movement towards entire freedom is,
      of course, Emile Zola. After having excited for many years an incredulous
      amazement and disgust, he is now almost universally recognised as an
      honest and honourable artist, and as a great master in his craft. Nobody
      who is at all instructed ventures any longer to say that Zola is indecent
      because he loves indecency, or is pleased by the contemplation of the
      squalid and obscene. We see him as he truly is&mdash;a pessimist in
      humanity&mdash;sad and oppressed, and bitter with the gall of a hopeless
      sympathy with suffering and distorted mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      One English artist, whom, in the just language of contemporary criticism,
      it is no exaggeration to describe as great, has elected (rather late in
      life for so strong a departure) to cast in his lot with the new school.
      That his ambitions are wholly honourable it would be the mere vanity of
      injustice to deny. That his new methods contrast very unfavourably with
      his old ones, that he is lending the weight of his authority to a movement
      which is full of mischief, that in obeying in all sincerity an artistic
      impulse he is doing a marked disservice to his own art in particular, and
      to English art in general, are with me so many rooted personal
      convictions; but I dare not pretend that they are more. Mr. Hardy is just
      as sincere in his belief that he is right as I and others among his
      critics are in our belief that he is wrong. The question must be threshed
      out dispassionately and judicially, if it be faced at all. It cannot be
      settled by an appeal to personal sentiment on either side. But in the
      limits to which I am now restricted it is impossible to do justice to the
      discussion, and it would, indeed, be barely possible to state even the
      whole of its terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am forced to content myself, therefore, with a temperamental expression
      of opinion in place of a judicial one, pleading only that the arguments
      against me are recognised and respected, although I have no present
      opportunity of recapitulating and disputing them. It appears, then&mdash;to
      speak merely as an advocate <i>ex parte</i>&mdash;to us of the old school
      that an essential part of the fiction writer&rsquo;s duty is to be harmless.
      That, of course, to the men of the cayenne-pepper-caster creed seems a
      very milky sort of proclamation, but to us it is a matter of grave moment.
      I have always thought, for my own part, that the novelist might well take
      for his motto the last five words of that passage in &lsquo;The Tempest&rsquo; where
      we read: &lsquo;This isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs, which <i>give
      delight and hurt not!</i> Simple as the motto seems, it will be found to
      offer a fairly wide range. When Reade tilted against prison abuses and the
      abuses of private asyla, or when Dickens rode down on the law of Chancery
      as administered in his day, or when Thackeray scourged snobbery and
      selfishness in society, they were all well within the limits of this rule.
      We experience a delight which hurts not, but on the contrary is entirely
      tonic and inspiring, when Satire swings his lash on the bared back of
      Hypocrisy or cruel and intentioned Vice. We experience a delight which
      hurts not, but on the contrary freshens the whole flood of feeling within
      us, when a true artist deals truly with the sorrows and infirmities of our
      kind. To offer it as our intent to give delight and hurt not is no mere
      profession of an artistic Grundyism. It is the proclamation of what is to
      our minds the simple truth, that fiction should be a joyful, an inspiring,
      a sympathetic, and a helpful art. There are certain questions the public
      discussion of which we purposely avoid. There are certain manifestations
      of character the exhibition of which we hold to be something like a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hardy would plead, and with perfectly apparent propriety, that he does
      not choose to write for &lsquo;the young person.&rsquo; But I answer that he cannot
      help himself. He cannot choose his audience. Fiction appeals to everybody,
      and fiction so robust, so delicate and charming as his own finds its way
      into all hands. When a man can take a hall, and openly advertise that he
      intends to speak therein &lsquo;to men only,&rsquo; he is reasonably allowed a certain
      latitude. If he pitches his cart on the village green, and talks with the
      village lads and lasses within hearing, he will, if he be a decent fellow,
      avoid the treatment of certain themes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To take the most striking example:&mdash;In &lsquo;Jude the Obscure&rsquo; Mr. Hardy
      deals very largely with the emotions and reasons which animate a young
      woman when she decides not to sleep with her husband, when she decides
      that she will sleep with her husband, when she decides to sleep with a man
      who is not her husband, and when she decides not to sleep with the man who
      is not her husband. Now, all this does not matter to the mentally solid
      and well-balanced reader. It is not very interesting, for one thing, and
      apart from the fact that it is, from a workman&rsquo;s point of view,
      astonishingly well done, it would not be interesting at all. Mr. Hardy
      offers it as the study of a temperament. Very well. It is an excellent
      study of a temperament, but it bores. The theme is not big enough to be
      worth the effort expended upon it. Here is an hysterical, wrong-headed,
      and confused-hearted little hussy who can&rsquo;t make up her mind as to what is
      right and what is wrong, and who is a prey to the impulse of the moment,
      psychical or physical. I don&rsquo;t think there are many people like her. I
      don&rsquo;t think that from the broad human-natural point of view it matters a
      great deal how she decides. But I am sure of this&mdash;that the more that
      kind of small monstrosity is publicly analysed and anatomised and made
      much of, the more her morbidities will increase in her, and the more
      unbearable in real life she is likely to become. Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s labour in
      this particular is a direct incentive to the study of hysteria as a fine
      art amongst such women as are natively prone to it. One of the gravest
      dangers which beset women is that of hysterical self-deception. The
      common-sense fashion of dealing with them when they suffer in that way is
      kindly and gently to ignore their symptoms until the reign of common-sense
      returns. To make them believe that their emotions are worthy of the
      scrutiny of a great analyst of the human heart is to increase their morbid
      temptations, and in the end to render those temptations irresistible. The
      one kind of person to whom &lsquo;Jude the Obscure&rsquo; must necessarily appeal with
      the greatest power is the kind of person depicted in its pages, and the
      tendency of the book is unavoidably towards the development and
      multiplication of the type described. This is the only end the book can
      serve, apart from the fact that it does reveal to us Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s special
      knowledge of a dangerous and disagreeable form of mental disorder, But it
      is not the physician&rsquo;s business to sow disease, and any treatise on
      hysteria which is thrown into a captivating popular form, and makes
      hysteria look like an interesting and romantic thing, will spread the
      malady as surely as a spark will ignite gunpowder. This at least is not a
      mere matter of opinion, but of sound scientific fact, which no student of
      that disorder which Mr. Hardy has so masterfully handled will deny. In
      this respect, then, the book is a centre of infection, and that the author
      of &lsquo;A Pair of Blue Eyes&rsquo; should have written it is matter at once for
      astonishment and grief. That is to say, it is a matter of astonishment and
      grief to me, and to those who think as I do. There is a large and growing
      contingent of writers and readers to whom it is a theme for joyful
      congratulation. It is one of the rules of the game we are now playing to
      respect all honest conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Mr. Hardy, from the purely artistic side, there is little time to
      speak. On that side let me first set down what is to be said in dispraise,
      for the mere sake of leaving a sweet taste in the mouth at the end. Even
      from his own point of view&mdash;that lauded &lsquo;sense of the overwhelming
      sadness of modern life&rsquo; which captivates the admirers of his latest style&mdash;it
      is possible to spread the epic table of sorrow without finding a place
      upon it for scraps of the hoggish anatomy which are not nameable except in
      strictly scientific or wholly boorish speech. But it seems necessary to
      the new realism that its devotee should be able to write for the perusal
      of gentlemen and ladies about things he dared not mention orally in the
      presence of either; so that what a drunken cabman would be deservedly
      kicked for saying in a lady&rsquo;s hearing may be honourably printed for a
      lady&rsquo;s reading by a scholar and a sage. It was once thought otherwise, but
      I am arguing here, not against realism <i>per se</i>, but against the
      inartistic introduction of gross episodes. Every reader of Mr. Hardy will
      recognise my meaning, and the passage in my mind seems gratuitously and
      unserviceably offensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      To come to less unpleasing themes, where, still expressing disapproval,
      one may do it with some grace, one of the few limitations to Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s
      great charm as a writer lies in his tendency to encumber his page with
      detail. At a supremely romantic moment one of his people sits down to
      contemplate a tribe of ants, and watches them through two whole printed
      pages. In another case a man in imminent deadly peril surveys through two
      pages the history of the geologic changes which have befallen our planet.
      Each passage, taken by itself, is good enough. Taken where it is, each is
      terribly wearisome and wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know that any critic has yet recorded Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s singular
      limitations as to the invention of plot. Speaking from memory, I cannot at
      this moment recall a novel of his in which some trouble does not circle
      about a marriage licence, and I can recall many instances of going to
      church to get married and coming back single. That, indeed, is Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s
      <i>pièce de résistance</i> in the way of invention, and it crops up in one
      book after another with a helpless inevitable-ness which at last grows
      comic.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here we can afford to have done with carping, and can turn to the much
      more grateful task of praise. I do not think it too much to say that Mr.
      Hardy has studied his own especial part of England, has made himself
      master of its landscape, its town and hamlet life, its tradition and
      sentiment, and general spiritual atmosphere, to such triumphant effect as
      to set himself wholly apart from all other English writers of fiction. His
      devotion to his own beloved Wessex has brought him this rich and merited
      reward&mdash;that he is the recognised first and final master of its
      field. His knowledge of rustic life within his own borders is beautifully
      sympathetic and profound. His impression of the landscape in the midst of
      which this life displays itself is broad and noble and alive. His literary
      style is a thing to admire, to study, and to admire again. All worthy
      readers of English fiction are his debtors for many idyllic happy hours,
      and many deep inspirations of wholesome English air. And if, at the
      parting of the ways, we wave a decisive farewell to him, we are not
      unmindful of the time when he was the best and dearest of our comrades,
      and we leave him in the certainty that, whatever path he has chosen, he
      has been guided in his choice by an ambition which is entirely honourable
      and sincere.

    <h2>
      VII.&mdash;UNDER FRENCH ENCOURAGEMENT&mdash;GEORGE MOORE
    </h2>
    <p>
      That salt of sincerity which saves &lsquo;Jude the Obscure&rsquo; and &lsquo;Tess o&rsquo; the
      D&rsquo;Urber-villes&rsquo; from being wholly nauseous, is absent from &lsquo;A Modern
      Lover&rsquo; and &lsquo;A Drama in Muslin,&rsquo; and its flavour is but faintly perceptible
      in &lsquo;Esther Waters.&rsquo; Except on the distinct understanding that Thomas Hardy
      and George Moore are bracketed here, for the sake of convenience, as being
      both &lsquo;under French encouragement,&rsquo; it would be a gross critical injustice
      to couple their names together at all. It is not one man of letters in a
      hundred who has Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s mere literary faculty, which is native and
      brilliant, whilst Mr. Moore&rsquo;s has been painstakingly hunted for and
      brought from afar, and is, after much polishing, still a trifle dull. Mr.
      Thomas Hardy is distinctly one of those men who see things through an
      atmosphere of their own. Mr. George Moore has borrowed his atmosphere. The
      one is a man of genius as well as labour, and the other is a man of labour
      only.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very much of a pity that, a year or two ago, somebody&rsquo;s sense of Mr.
      Moore&rsquo;s position in the world of letters should have been very absurdly
      emphasised. It was solemnly advertised that a certain number of copies of
      a book of his might be had on large paper, with the autograph of the
      author. This was to be regretted, for Mr. Moore, in his own way, is worth
      taking seriously, whilst the trick is one of those which, as a rule, can
      only be played by the poorest kind of literary outsider. But that the
      author should have permitted himself to be thus made ridiculous is a
      characteristic thing, and one not to be passed in silence if we wish to
      understand him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consulting the critics, one of the first things we find about Mr. Moore is
      that he is an observer. As a matter of fact, that is absolutely what he is
      not. He is so far from being an observer that he is that diametrically
      opposite person, a man with a notebook. The man who amongst men of letters
      deserves to be ranked as an observer is he who naturally and without
      effort sees things in their just place, aspect, proportion, and
      perspective. The man who is often falsely described by the title which
      expresses this faculty is a careful and painstaking soul, who is
      strenuously on the watch for detail, and who takes much trouble to fill
      his pages with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me offer a concrete illustration. In &lsquo;Esther Waters&rsquo; Mr. Moore is
      curiously and meaninglessly emphatic in his description of a certain room
      in which the heroine of his action sleeps. Esther, we are told, slipped on
      her nightdress and got into bed. It was a brass bed without curtains.
      There were two windows in the room. One of them was flush with the head of
      the bed, and the other was beyond its foot. A chest of drawers stood
      between them. An observer, unless he had a special purpose in it, would
      never have dreamt of writing down this bald detail. Nothing comes of the
      statement of fact. Nothing hangs on the relative position of the bed and
      the windows and the chest of drawers. Nothing happens in the course of the
      story which justifies the flat and flavourless statement. It is wholly
      without meaning, apart from the fact that it affords rather a plain
      insight into the author&rsquo;s method of work. If a child of three after
      visiting a strange bedroom were able to tell as much about it as Mr. Moore
      has to tell about this apartment, his mother would probably be proud of
      him, and his nurse would say that he was a notice-taking little creature;
      but the critics would hardly hold him up to admiration as an observer. Yet
      the child would tell us just as much and just as little as Mr. Moore tells
      us in this particular instance. It goes without saying that this is not a
      fair specimen of Mr. Moore&rsquo;s faculty, but it is significant of his general
      literary knack. He makes it his business steadfastly to jot down what he
      sees, and it is not impossible that in the course of a long and laborious
      life a man might in this way cultivate to a reasonable growth a turn for
      observation originally less than mediocre; but it is not the natural
      observer&rsquo;s method of seeing things, and it is not the natural artist&rsquo;s
      method of presenting them. If the critics in this case were in the right
      we should have to acknowledge an auctioneer&rsquo;s catalogue as a <i>chef
      d&rsquo;ouvre</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the sympathetic reader it was evident from the first that Mr. Moore was
      not greatly enamoured of his work for its own sake, and that he chose his
      themes, not because of any imperative attraction they had for him, but
      simply and purely for the use to which he could put them. His choice of
      subject has always been the result of a deliberate search for the
      effective. The mental process which gave rise to &lsquo;A Mummer&rsquo;s Wife&rsquo; is
      easily traceable. The domestic life of the class of people he made up his
      mind to treat was as little known to him as to almost anybody, but if
      properly handled it was pretty sure to make good copy. He must know it
      first, however, and so he set himself to learn it. This is the Zola
      method, but it is that method with a difference. The great French master
      started with an inspired and inspiring scheme, his idea being no less than
      to paint the society of an epoch from top to base, to present in a series
      of books, the writing of which should fill his literary lifetime, a
      completed portraiture of the whole people of his land and day. In the
      course of such a labour as he had courageously appointed for himself, many
      lines of special inquiry were necessarily indicated, but the details for
      which he searched were all employed with an artistic remorselessness in
      the building of that one great scheme of his, and each successive book
      which left his hands was like one more nail driven home and clinched for
      the support of his argument. Mr. Moore, as those who are honoured by his
      personal acquaintance know better than those who only read his books,
      resents with some warmth the obvious parallel which has been drawn between
      Zola and himself; but he is a copyist of Zola&rsquo;s method for all that, and
      but for Zola&rsquo;s influence would never have been heard of on his own present
      lines. In the writing of the &lsquo;Mummers Wife&rsquo; the first obvious impulse came
      from Zola, It should be the writer&rsquo;s business to discover a section of
      English life not hitherto exploited&mdash;it should be his business to
      explore it with a minute thoroughness&mdash;and it should, further, be his
      business to depict it as he found it. To be thoroughly painstaking in
      inquiry, and without fear in the exposition of facts discovered, were the
      aims before the writer. But Mr. Moore forgot, as was inevitable in the
      circumstances, that no desire for knowledge of things human is of real
      value without sympathy. He followed the fortunes of a theatrical company
      touring in the provinces, and though it is true enough that people who
      know that kind of life find trivial errors here and there, it has to be
      admitted that on the whole he gave a true and characteristic picture of
      the outside life of such a community. How a certain class of theatrical
      people dress and talk, what their work is, and what their outer ways are
      like, he has discovered with infinite painstaking; but the fact remains
      that it is the work of an outsider. He has never once got under the skin
      of any one of his people, and this is true, because he was impelled to
      write about them, not because they were human, and therefore endowed with
      all human characteristics of hatefulness, and lovableness, and quaintness,
      and humour, and vanity, and jealousy, but because he saw good copy in
      them. He neither loves nor hates, nor, indeed, except for his own sake, is
      for a. second even faintly interested. He is there to make a book, and
      these people offer excellent material for a book. He is astonishingly
      industrious, and his minuteness is without end, but he never warms to his
      subject. His aim, in short, is one of total artistic selfishness. It is
      very likely that he would accept this statement of his standpoint, and
      would justify it as the only standpoint of an artist. But it is answerable
      for the fact that his pages are sterile of laughter and tears, of sympathy
      and of pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In &lsquo;A Modern Lover&rsquo; and &lsquo;A Drama in Muslin&rsquo; we find him dealing with a
      life he knows. He is no longer on ground wholly foreign to him, and it is
      no longer necessary that he should grope from one uncertain standing place
      to another, verifying himself by the dark lantern of his note-book as he
      goes. He moves with a more natural ease, views things with a larger and
      more comprehensive eye, and has at least that outside sympathy with his
      people which comes of community of taste and knowledge, and of familiarity
      with a social <i>milieu</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In &lsquo;Esther Waters&rsquo; the earlier characteristics break out again, and break
      out with greater force than ever. What he calls&mdash;with one of those
      tumbles into foreign idiom which occasionally mark his pages&mdash;&lsquo;the
      fever of the gamble&rsquo; has never been truly diagnosed in English fiction,
      and the theme is undeniably fertile. He knows absolutely nothing about the
      manifestations of the disorder, to begin with; but that is of no
      consequence, for the world is open to observation; and the note-book, the
      inquiring mind, and the sleuthhound patience are all as available as ever.
      Then a combination occurs to him. Servantgalism awaits; its painter. The
      life is picturesque from a certain point of view: it impinges more or less
      on the lives of all of us, and nobody has hitherto thought it worth while
      to search into its mysteries, and to tell us what it is really like. He
      knows nothing at all about this either, but he will make inquiries. He
      does make inquiries, and they result in a picture which is, on the whole,
      a piece of surprising accuracy. But still all the fire is for the work.
      The subject is sought for, the details are gathered, the workman&rsquo;s
      patience and labour are truly conscientious&mdash;at times they excite
      admiration and surprise&mdash;but the net result is lifeless. In the way
      of waxwork&mdash;it would be hard to find anything more effective than the
      people in &lsquo;Esther Waters.&rsquo; They are clothed with an exactitude of detail
      which would do credit to Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s exhibition in its latest
      development. They are carefully modelled and coloured and posed. They are
      capital waxwork, and if the author had only cared a little bit about them,
      they might have even that mystic touch of life which thrills us in the
      finer sorts of fiction. It is eternally true that the wounded is the
      wounding heart, and the mere descriptive and analytical method not only
      misses the natural human movement, but it is untrue in its results.
      Vivisection teaches something, no doubt, but it does not bring a knowledge
      of the natural animal. To get that knowledge you had better live with him
      a little, and even love him a little, and teach him to love you. All the
      scientific inquiry in the world is not worth&mdash;in art&mdash;one touch
      of affectionate understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Esther Waters is to go to a lying-in hospital, and thither goes her author
      before her, bent on what he can picturesquely set down about her
      surroundings. Her husband is to go to a hospital for consumption. Thither
      goes the author, and sets down things seen and heard with the wooden,
      conscientious precision of a bailiff&rsquo;s clerk. The conception of things
      inquired into seems never to move him to interest, though one is forced to
      believe that once, at least, he has narrowly escaped the contagion of a
      great scene. Esther&rsquo;s illegitimate child is born, and the mother, who has
      temporarily left him for his own sake, to accept a position as wet-nurse,
      is inspired by a hungry maternal longing, which drags her irresistibly
      from warmth and comfort to a poverty whose bitterness has but a single
      solace&mdash;the joy of satisfied motherly love. There are writers who
      have not a hundredth part of Mr. Moore&rsquo;s industry who would have moved the
      reader deeply with such a scene. But, if Mr. Moore feels at all, he is
      ashamed to show it. This mother-hunger is apparently just as affecting a
      thing to him as the position of the chest of drawers between the two
      windows&mdash;a fact made note of, and, therefore, to be chronicled.
      Either the writer is content coldly to survey this rage of passion, or he
      would have us believe he is so; and in either case he misses the mark of
      the artist, which is, after all, to show such things as he deals with as
      they truly are, and to seize upon their inwardness. We do not ask for a
      slavering flux of sentiment, or an acrobat&rsquo;s display in gesticulation.
      But, from a gentleman whose corns when trodden on are probably as painful
      as his neighbours&rsquo;, we are content with something less than a godlike
      indifference to the emotions of humanity. Let us suppose, charitably, that
      this is no more than a pretence, and that Mr. Moore is neither at heart so
      callous nor in vanity so far removed from mere emotional interests as he
      would seem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most patient of investigators in strange regions will make slips
      sometimes. Mr. Moore, for instance, investigating the racing stable,
      treats us to a view of a horse whose legs are tightly bandaged from his
      knees to his forelocks, and his vulgarest peasants and servants say &lsquo;that
      is he,&rsquo; or &lsquo;if it be.&rsquo; One characteristic of the common speech of our
      country he has caught with accuracy, though it can scarcely be said that
      it needed much observation to secure it. The very objectionable word
      &lsquo;bloody,&rsquo; as it is used by the vulgar, is Mr. Moore&rsquo;s &lsquo;standby&rsquo; in &lsquo;Esther
      Waters,&rsquo; It is very likely that it takes a sort of daring to introduce the
      word freely into a work of fiction, but the courage does not seem very
      much more respectable than the word.

    <h2>
      VIII.&mdash;MR. S. R. CROCKETT&mdash;IAN MACLAREN
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I undertook the writing of this series, Mr. S. R. Crockett, except
      for his &lsquo;Mad Sir Uchtred of the Hills,&rsquo; was unknown to me by actual
      reading. My opinion of that story was not a high one. I thought it, and on
      a second reading still think it, feebly pretentious. But for some reason
      or another Mr. Crockett&rsquo;s name has been buzzed about in such a prodigality
      of praise that it came natural to believe and hope that later work from
      his pen had shown a quality which the first little <i>brochure</i> had not
      revealed, and that the world had found in him a genuine addition to its
      regiment of literary workmen. The curiosity with which a section of the
      newspaper press has been inspired as to Mr. Crockett&rsquo;s personal
      whereabouts, as to his comings and goings, his engagements for the future,
      and his prices &lsquo;per thousand words,&rsquo; would have seemed to indicate that in
      him we had discovered a person of considerably more than the average
      height.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of a completer perusal of his writings is not merely
      destructive of this hope. It is positively stunning and bewildering. Mr.
      Crockett is not only not a great man, but a rather futile very small one.
      The unblushing effrontery of those gentlemen of the press who have set <i>him</i>
      on a level with Sir Walter is the most mournful and most contemptible
      thing in association with the poorer sort of criticism which has been
      encountered of late years.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no part of an honest critic&rsquo;s business to be personally offensive.
      It is no part of his function to find a pleasure in giving pain. But it is
      a part of his business, which is not to be escaped, to do his fearless
      best to tell the truth, and the truth about Mr. Crockett and the press is
      not to be told without giving deep offence, to him and it. Fortunately,
      the press is a very wide corporation indeed, and if there are venal people
      employed upon it, there are at least as many scrupulously honourable; and
      if there are stupid people who can be carried by a cry, there are men of
      all grades of brilliant ability, ranging from genius to talent To put the
      matter in plain English will offend neither honesty nor ability, and to
      give offence to venality or incompetence is not an act of peculiar daring.
    </p>
    <p>
      In plain English, then, it is not a matter of opinion as to whether Mr.
      Crockett is worthy of the stilted encomium which has mopped and mowed
      about him. It is not a matter of opinion as to whether Mr. Crockett has or
      has not rivalled Sir Walter. It is a matter of absolute fact, about which
      no two men who are even moderately competent to judge can dispute for a
      second. The newspaper press, or a very considerable section of it, has
      conspired to set Mr. Crockett upon an eminence so removed from his fitness
      for it that he is made ridiculous by the mere fact of being perched there.
      When Robert Louis Stevenson suffered from the hysteria of praise, the
      natural feeling was to save an exquisite artist from the excusable
      exaltations of enthusiasm. When the genuine art and real fun and touching
      pathos of Mr. J. M. Barrie hurried his admirers into uncritical ecstasy,
      one&rsquo;s only fear was lest the popular taste should take an undeserved
      revenge in coldness and neglect. To say in the first flush of affection
      and enjoyment that &lsquo;A Window in Thrums&rsquo; is as good as Sir Walter, or that
      &lsquo;The Master of Ballantrae&rsquo; is better, is not to exercise the faculty of a
      critic; but it is not monstrous or absurd. It is the expression of a
      momentary happy ebullience, a natural ejaculation of gratitude for a
      beautiful gift. It is only when the judgment comes to be persisted in that
      we find any element of danger in it. It is only when gravely and
      strenuously repeated, as in Stevenson&rsquo;s case, that it is to be resented,
      and then mainly on the ground that it does harm to the object of it. But
      in the case now under review the conditions are not the same. Poor
      Stevenson, whose early death is still a poignant grief was indubitably a
      man of genius. Settle the question of stature how you may, there is no
      denying the species to which such a writer belongs. Mr. Barrie <i>has</i>
      genius&mdash;which is a slightly different thing. But Mr. Crockett in the
      great rank of letters is &lsquo;as just and mere a serving-man as any born of
      woman,&rsquo; and there has been as much banging of the paragraphic drum
      concerning him, and as assured a proclamation of his mastership, as if
      every high quality of genius were recognisable in him at a glance. If I
      knew of any unmistakable and tangible reason for all this I would not
      hesitate to name it, but I am not in the secret, and I have no right to
      guess. There are some sort of strings somewhere, and somebody pulls them.
      So much is evident on the face of things. Who work the contemptible <i>fantoccini</i>
      who gesticulate to the Ephesian hubbub of &lsquo;greatness&rsquo; I neither know nor
      care, but it is simply out of credence that their motions are spontaneous.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Expede Herculem</i>. I will take a solitary story from Mr. Crockett&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;Stickit Minister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It is called &lsquo;The Courtship of Allan Fairley,&rsquo; The tale is of a young
      minister of the peasant class, whose parents through much privation have
      kept their son at college. He is elected to a living in an aristocratic
      parish, and takes his old peasant mother to keep house for him. Some of
      his more polished parishioners object to the old lady&rsquo;s presence at the
      manse, and they have the rather astonishing impertinence to propose that
      the son shall send her away. He refuses, and shows his visitors the door.
      These are the bare lines of the story so far as we are concerned with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think how Dr. Macdonald or J. M. Barrie would have handled this! The
      humour of either would have danced round the crass obtuseness of the
      deputation and the mingled wrath and amusement of the minister. The story
      bristles with opportunity for the presentation of human contrast. The
      chances are all there, and a story-teller of anything like genuine faculty
      could not have failed to see and to utilise some of them. Mr. Crockett
      misses every conceivable point of his own tale, and with a majestic
      clumsiness drags in the one thing which could possibly make it offensive.
      The minister has nothing to fear from his visitors, for it is expressly
      stated that he has a majority of three hundred and sixty-five in his
      spiritual constituency of four hundred and thirty-five. But Mr. Crockett&rsquo;s
      point is that he was a hero for refusing to kick his own mother out of
      doors. He makes Mr. Allan Fairley tell his own tale, and the end of this
      portion of it runs thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He got no further; he wadna hae gotten as far if for a moment I had
      jaloosed his drift I got on my feet I could hardly keep my hands off them,
      minister as I was, but I said: &ldquo;Gentlemen, you are aware of what you ask
      me to do? You ask me to turn out of the house the mither that bore me, the
      mither that learnt me &lsquo;The Lord&rsquo;s my Shepherd,&rsquo; the mither that wore her
      fingers near the bone that I might gang to the college, that selled her
      bit plenishin&rsquo; that my manse micht be furnished! Ye ask me to show her to
      the door&mdash;I&rsquo;ll show you to the door!&rdquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; to the door they
      gaed!&rsquo; &ldquo;Weel done! That was my ain Allan!&rdquo; cried I.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there ever a piece of sentiment cheaper, falser, more tawdry? Who
      applauds a man for not turning his old mother out of doors at the
      impertinent request of a meddling nobody? Look at the stormy small
      capitals of this oatmeal hero, who is supposed to electrify us by the mere
      fact of his not being an incredible ass and scoundrel! Does any sober
      person think for a moment that a man of genius could have made this
      revolting blunder? It is beyond comparison the densest bit of stupidity in
      dealing with the emotions I have encountered anywhere. Anybody but Mr.
      Crockett can see where the point of the story lies. It lies in the cool
      impertinence and heartlessness of his visitors. To put the emphasis on the
      rejection of their proposal&mdash;to make a point of <i>that</i>&mdash;is
      to insult the reader. Of course it was rejected. How should it possibly,
      by any stretch of poltroonery and baseness, be otherwise?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ex pede Herculem</i>. This bedrummed and betrumpeted man of genius
      cannot read the A B <i>ab</i> of the human emotions. &lsquo;Here!&rsquo; says the
      subtle tempter, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you twopence if you&rsquo;ll put your baby on the
      fire!&rsquo; The god-like hero thunders: &lsquo;No! He is my flesh and blood. He is
      the sacred trust of Heaven. He is innocent, he is helpless. I&rsquo;ll show you
      to the door!&rsquo; Oh! what emotions stir within the heart when a master&rsquo;s hand
      awakes a chord like this!
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, of course, a certain angry pleasure in this necessary work; but
      it does not endure, and it is followed rapidly by a reaction of pain and
      pity. But we have a right to ask&mdash;we have a right to insist&mdash;that
      undeserved reputations shall not be manufactured for us by any clique. We
      have a right to protest when the offence is open and flagrant. Let it be
      said, if it be not too late to say it, that Mr. Crockett, if left alone by
      his indiscreet admirers, or only puffed within the limits of the
      reasonable, might have been regarded as an honest workman as times go,
      when everybody, more or less, writes fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      If his pages had come before me as the work of an unknown man, seeking his
      proper place in the paper republic, it is certain that I could have found
      some honest and agreeable things to say about him. But, unfortunately, he,
      more than any other writer of his day, has been signalled out for those
      uncostly extravagances of praise which are fast discrediting us in our own
      eyes, and are making what should be the art of criticism a mockery, and
      something of a shame. In what I have written I have dealt less with his
      work than with the false estimate of it which, for a year or two, has been
      thrust upon the public by a certain band of writers who are either
      hopelessly incompetent to assess our labours or incurably dishonest, It is
      very possible indeed that Mr. Crockett is wholly undeserving of censure in
      this regard, that he has not in any way asked or aided the manufacture of
      this balloon of a reputation in which he has been floated to such heights.
      Apart from the pretensions of his <i>claque</i>, there is no earthly
      reason why a critic should hold him up to ridicule. It is not he who is
      ridiculous, but at its best his position is respectable, and he holds his
      place (like the mob of us who write for a living) for the moment only. To
      pretend that he is a man of genius, to talk about him in the same breath
      with Sir Walter Scott, to chronicle his comings and his goings as if he
      were the embodiment of a new revelation, is to provoke a natural and just
      resentment The more plainly that resentment is expressed&mdash;the more it
      is seen that a false adulation is the seed of an open contempt&mdash;the
      less likely writers of middling faculty will be to encourage a bloated
      estimate of themselves.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Since the above was written and printed Mr. Crockett has
     published his story of &lsquo;Lads&rsquo; Love,&rsquo; the final chapter of
     which is so good that in reading it I experienced a twinge
     of regret for the onslaught I had made. But after all it is
     not the author who is attacked in what goes before, and if,
     in the fray with the critics, he is, incidentally, as it
     were, somewhat roughly handled, the over-enthusiasm of his
     professional admirers must bear the blame. There is much
     prentice work in &lsquo;Lads&rsquo; Love,&rsquo; some strenuously enforced
     emotion, which is not genuine, and a congenital
     misunderstanding of the essential difference between tedium
     and humour; but if the whole of Mr. Crockett&rsquo;s work had
     reached its level, the protest against his reviewers would
     have stood in need of modification.]
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Ian Maclaren, though he is distinctly an imitator, and may be said to
      owe his literary existence to Mr. J. M. Barrie, is both artistic and
      sympathetic. His work conveys to the reader the impression of an encounter
      with Barrie in a dream. The keen edges of the original are blurred and
      partly lost, but the author of &lsquo;Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush&rsquo; has many
      excellent qualities, and if he had had the good fortune or the initiative
      to be first in the field, his work would have been almost wholly charming.
      As it is, he still shows much faculty of intuition and of heart, and his
      work is all sympathetically honest His emotions are genuine, and this in
      the creation of emotional fiction is the first essential to success. Here
      is another case where the hysteric overpraise of the critics has done a
      capable workman a serious injustice, and but for it a candid reviewer
      could have no temptation towards blame. His inspiration is from the
      outside, but that is the harshest word that can honestly be spoken, and in
      days when literature has become a trade such a judgment is not severe.

    <h2>
      IX.&mdash;DR. MACDONALD AND MR. J. M. BARRIE
    </h2>
    <p>
      When one calls to mind the rapid and extensive popularity achieved by the
      latest school of Scottish dialect writers, one is tempted to wonder a
      little at the comparative neglect which has befallen a real master of that
      <i>genre</i>, who is still living and writing, and who began his work
      within the memory of the middle-aged. With the single exception of &lsquo;A
      Window in Thrums,&rsquo; none of the new books of this school are worthy to be
      compared with &lsquo;David Elginbrod,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Alec Forbes of Howglen,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Robert
      Falconer.&rsquo; Yet not one of them has failed to find a greater vogue or to
      bring to its author a more swelling reputation than Dr. Mac-donald
      achieved. Perhaps the reasons for these facts are not far to seek. To
      begin at the beginning, Sir Walter, who created the Scottish character
      novel, had made, in other fields, a reputation quite unparalleled in the
      history of fiction before he took broadly to the use of Scottish rural
      idiom, and the depiction of Scottish character in its peculiarly local
      aspects. The magic of his name compelled attention, and his genius gave a
      classic flavour to dialects until then regarded as barbarous and ugly. The
      flame of Burns had already eaten all grossness out of the rudest
      rusticities, and in the space of twenty years at most the Auld Braid Scots
      wore the dignity of a language and was decorated with all the honours of a
      literature. But this, in spite of the transcendent genius of the two men
      to whom northern literature owes its greatest debt, brought about very
      little more than a local interest and a local pride. Scott was accepted in
      spite of the idiom which he sometimes employed, and not because of it, and
      one can only laugh at the fancy presented to the mind by the picture of an
      English or a foreign reader who for the first time found himself
      confronted by Mrs. Bartlemy Saddletree&rsquo;s query to her maid: &lsquo;What gart ye
      busk your cockernony that gait?&rsquo; To this hour, indeed, there are thousands
      of Scott&rsquo;s admirers for whom the question might just as well be framed in
      Sanscrit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Sir Walters own day and generation he had one considerable imitator in
      Galt, whose &lsquo;Andrew Wylie of that Ilk&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Entail&rsquo; can still afford
      pleasure to the reader. Then for a time the fiction of Scottish character
      went moribund. The prose Muse of the North was silent, or spoke in
      ineffectual accents. After a long interregnum came George Macdonald,
      unconsciously paving the way for the mob of northern gentlemen who now
      write with ease. He brought to his task an unusual fervour, a more than
      common scholarship, a more than common richness, purity, and flexibility
      in style, a truly poetic endowment of imagination, and a truly human
      endowment of sympathy, intuition, and insight. It would be absurd to say
      that he failed, but it is certain that he scarcely received a tithe either
      of the praise or the pudding which have fallen to the share of Mr. S. R.
      Crockett, for example, who is no more to be compared with him than I to
      Hercules. Such readers as were competent to judge of him ranked him high,
      but, south of the Tweed, such readers were few and far between, for he
      employed the idiomatic Scotch in which he chose to work with a remorseless
      accuracy, and in this way set up for himself a barrier against the average
      Englishman. His genius, charming as it was, was not of that tremendous and
      compulsive sort which lays a hand on every man, and makes the breaking
      down of such a barrier an essential to intellectual happiness. There was a
      tacit admission that he was, in his measure, a great man, but that the
      average reader could afford to let him alone. And then, things were very
      different with the press. The northern part of this island, though active
      in press life, had nothing like its influence of to-day. To-day the press
      of Great Britain swarms with Scotchmen, and the &lsquo;boom&rsquo; which has lately
      filled heaven and earth with respect to the achievements of the new Scotch
      school has given ample and even curious evidence of that fact. The spoils
      to the victor, by all means. We folk from over the border are a warlike
      and a self-approving race, with a strong family instinct, and a passionate
      love for the things which pertain to our own part of the world. If
      Scotchmen had been as numerous amongst pressmen as they are to-day, and as
      certain of their power, they would have boomed Dr. Macdonald beyond a
      doubt. Such recognition as he received came mainly from them. But if only
      the present critical conditions had existed in his early day, with what
      garlands would he have been wreathed, what sacrifices would have been made
      before him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from that rugged inaccessibility of dialect (to the merely English
      reader) which so often marks Dr. Macdonald&rsquo;s work, there is in the main
      theme of his best books a reason why he should not be widely popular. The
      one issue in which he is most passionately interested is theological. He
      has been to many a Moses in the speculative desert, leading to a land of
      promise. He has preached with a tender and persuasive fire the divine
      freedom of the soul, and its essential oneness with the Fatherhood of God.
      He has expended many beautiful faculties on this work, and his influence
      in the broadening and deepening of religious thought in Scotland is not to
      be denied. But his insistence on this great theme has naturally scared
      away the empty-headed and the shallow-hearted, and many also of the
      careless clever. There must be somewhere a fund of sincerity and of reason
      in the reader to whom he appeals. There is a public which is prepared to
      encounter thought, which can be genuinely stirred by a high intellectual
      passion, which is athirst indeed for that highest and best enjoyment, but
      it is numerically small, and the writer who deals mainly with spiritual
      problems, and who, in doing so, is reticent and reverent, can scarcely
      hope to draw the mob at his wheels. In each of his three best books, Dr.
      Macdonald has traced the growth of a soul towards freedom. His conception
      of freedom is a reasoned but absolute submission to a Divine Will; a sense
      of absorption in the manifest intent of a guiding Power which is wholly
      loving and wholly wise. To all who are able to read him he is exquisitely
      interesting and delightful, and to some he appeals with the authority of a
      prophet and divinely-appointed guide. Along with this experience of
      abiding faith in him goes a dash of mysticism, of pantheism. He is
      essentially a poet, and had he chosen to expend more labour upon his verse
      he might have risen to high rank on that side. But with him the thing to
      be said has seemed vastly more important than the way of saying it, and he
      has, perhaps rightly, disdained to be laborious in the mere texture of his
      verse. It is rational to argue that if the poetic, inspiration is not
      vital enough to find an immediate expression it is not true enough to make
      it worth while to remould and recast it. It would seem&mdash;judging by
      results&mdash;that Dr. Macdonald&rsquo;s conception of a lyric is of something
      wholly spontaneous. Be this as it may, the poetic cast of his mind is
      revealed in his prose with greater freedom and a completer charm than in
      his verse. The best of him is the atmosphere he carries. It is not
      possible to read his books and not to know him for a brave, sincere, and
      loyal man, large both in heart and brain, and they purify and tone the
      mind in just such fashion as the air of mountain, moor, or sea purifies
      and tones the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthiest of his successors is Mr. J. M. Barrie, who has much in
      common with him, though he displays differences of a very essential kind.
      Mr. Barrie has no such spiritual obsession as besets his elder. He has the
      national reverence for sacred things, but it is probably rather habitual
      and racial than dogmatic. I think his greatest charm lies in the fact that
      he is at once old and new fashioned. He loves to deal with a bygone form
      of life, a form of life which he is too young to remember in all its
      intricacies, whilst he is not too young to have heard of it plenteously at
      first hand, or to have known many of its exemplars. Few things of so happy
      a sort can befall a child of imagination as to be born on such a
      borderland of time. About him is the atmosphere of the new, and dotted
      every here and there around him are the living mementoes of the old&mdash;a
      dying age, which in a little while will cease to be, and is already out of
      date and romantic. Steam and electricity and the printing-press, and the
      universal provider and the cheap clothing &lsquo;emporium,&rsquo; have worked strange
      changes. It was Mr. Barrie&rsquo;s fortune to begin to look on life when all
      these changes were not yet wrought; to bring an essentially modern mind to
      bear on the contemplation of a vanishing and yet visible past, to live
      with the quaint, yet to be able, by mere force of contrast, to recognise
      its quaintness, and to be in close and constant and familiar touch with
      those to whom the disappearing forms of life had been wholly habitual.
      That the mere environment thus indicated was the lot of hundreds of
      thousands makes little difference to the especial happiness of the chance,
      for, as I have said already, we can&rsquo;t all be persons of genius, and it is
      only to the man of genius that, the good fortune comes home.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is one truth in relation to the craft of fiction of which I am
      more convinced than another, it is that all the genuine and original
      observation of which a man is capable is made in very early life. There
      are two very obvious reasons why this should be so. The fact that they are
      obvious need not prevent me from stating them here, since I am not writing
      for those who make a business of knowing such things. In the first place,
      the mind is at its freshest; and all objects within its scope have a
      keen-edged interest, which wears away in later life. In the next place,
      the earliest observations are our own, unmixed with the conclusions and
      prepossessions of other minds. A child has not learnt the Dickens&rsquo; 
      fashion, or the Thackeray fashion, or the Superior Person fashion of
      surveying particulars and generals. He has not begun to obscure his
      intelligence by the vicious habit of purposed note-takings for literary
      uses. He looks at the things which interest him simply, naturally, and
      with entire absorption. It is true of the most commonplace people that as
      they grow old their minds turn back to childhood, and they remember the
      things of half a century ago with more clearness than the affairs of last
      week. Lord Lytton&rsquo;s definition of a man of genius was that he preserved
      the child&rsquo;s capacity for wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the astutest of living critics tells me that he finds a curiously
      <i>logical</i> characteristic in Mr. Barrie&rsquo;s humour, but I confess that I
      am not wholly clear as to his meaning. I find it characteristically
      Scotch, and perhaps at bottom we mean the same thing. It is often sly, and
      so conscious in its enjoyment of itself as to be content to remain unseen.
      Often it lies in a flavour of the mind, as in whole pages of &lsquo;My Lady
      Nicotine,&rsquo; where it is a mere placid, lazy acquiescence in the generally
      humorous aspect of things. Here the writer finds himself amused, and so
      may you if you happen to be in the mood. At other times the fun bubbles
      with pure spontaneity, as in the courtship of &lsquo;Tnowhead&rsquo;s Bell, which is,
      I make bold to believe, as good a bit of Scotch rural comedy as we have
      had for many a day. The comedy is broad, and touches the edge of farce at
      times, but it is always kept on the hither-side by its droll appreciation
      of character, and an air of complete gravity in the narrator, who, for any
      indication he gives to the contrary, might be dealing with the most
      serious of chronicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I write I have before me a letter of Mr. Barrie&rsquo;s, written to a
      fellow-workman, in which he speaks of the &lsquo;almost unbearable pathos&rsquo; of an
      incident in one of the latter&rsquo;s pages. The phrase seems to fit accurately
      that chapter in the &lsquo;Window in Thrums&rsquo; where Jamie, after his fall in
      London, returns to his old home, and finds his own people dead and
      scattered. The story is simple, and the style is severe even to dryness,
      but every word is like a nail driven home. It would be hard to find in
      merely modern work a chapter written with a more masterly economy of
      means, than this. And this economy of means is the most striking
      characteristic of Mr. Barrie&rsquo;s literary style. It is as different from the
      forced economy of poverty as the wordy extravagance of Miss Corelli is
      different from the exuberance of Shakspeare. It is a reasoned, laborious,
      and self-chastening art, and within its own limitations it is art at its
      acme of achievement What it has set itself to do it has done.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two, then, Dr. George Macdonald and Mr. J. M. Barrie, are the men
      who worthily carry on, in their separate and distinct fashions, the
      tradition which Sir Walter established. In a summary like this, where it
      is understood that at least a loyal effort is being made to recognise and
      apportion the merits of rival writers, the task of the critic occasionally
      grows ungrateful. Nothing short of sheer envy can grudge to Mr. Barrie a
      high meed of praise, but I think that his elder is his better. The younger
      man&rsquo;s distinction is very largely due to a fine self-command, a faculty of
      self-criticism, which in its way cannot easily be overpraised. He has not
      Stevenson&rsquo;s exquisite and yet daring appropriateness in the choice of
      words, but his humour is racier and scarcely less delicate, and in
      passages of pathos he knows his way straight to the human heart As the
      invention or discovery of new themes grows day by day less easy&mdash;as
      the bounds of the story-teller&rsquo;s personal originality are constantly
      narrowing&mdash;the purely literary faculty, the mere craft of authorship
      in its finer manifestations must of necessity grow more valuable. Mr.
      Barrie is a captain amongst workmen, and there is little fear that in the
      final judgment of the public and his peers he will be huddled up with
      Maclarens and Crocketts, as he sometimes is to-day. But Dr. Mac-donald,
      though he has not sought for the finenesses of mere literary art with an
      equal jealousy, has inherited a bigger fortune, and has spent his ownings
      with a larger hand. He has perhaps narrowed his following by his
      faithfulness to his own inspiration, but his books are a genuine
      benefaction to the heart, and no man can read them honestly without
      drawing from them a spiritual freshness and purity of the rarer sort.
      There is an old story of a discussion among the students of their time as
      to the relative merits of Schiller and Goethe, The dispute came to
      Schiller&rsquo;s ears, and he laughingly advised the combatants to cease
      discussion, and to be thankful that they had both. I could take a personal
      refuge there with all pleasure, but the critical rush to crown the new
      gods is a new thing, and, without stealing a leaf from the brow of the
      younger writer, I should like to see a fresher and a brighter crown upon
      the head of his elder and bigger brother.

    <h2>
      X.&mdash;THE PROBLEM SEEKERS&mdash;SEA CAPTAIN AND LAND CAPTAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is so long a time since Mr. W. H. Mallock published the &lsquo;Romance of the
      Nineteenth Century&rsquo; that the book might now very well be left alone, if it
      were not for the fact that in a fashion it marked an epoch in the history
      of English literature. It was, so far as I know, the first example of the
      School of the Downright Nasty. For half a year it ran in &lsquo;Belgravia&rsquo; side
      by side with a novel of my own, and under those conditions I read as much
      as I could stand of it. Its main object appears to be to establish the
      theory that a young woman of refined breeding may be an amateur harlot.
      The central male figure of the book is a howling bounder, who has a
      grievance against the universe because he can&rsquo;t entirely understand it.
      Within the last two or three years it has occurred to Mr. Mallock to
      recast the book, and in a preface dated 1893 (I think) he informs the
      world that on re-reading the story he personally has found portions of it
      to be offensive. These portions he declares himself to have eliminated,
      and he now thinks&mdash;or thought in 1893&mdash;that there is nothing on
      that score to cavil at. All I remembered of the story was that a certain
      Colonel Stapleton debauched the mind of the heroine by lending her obscene
      books with obscene prints attached. This episode is retained, in spite of
      the work of purification which has been performed; and it may be said that
      if the original novel were nastier than this deodorised edition of it, it
      is very much of a wonder how the critical stomach kept it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a refreshment to turn from this particular problem seeker to the
      work of a writer like Mrs. Humphry Ward, who, if she invests the questions
      she handles with more importance than actually belongs to them, is as
      wholesome and sincere as one could ask. She has read both deeply and
      widely, she thinks with sanity and clearness, she discerns character, she
      can create and tell a story, her style is excellently succinct and full,
      and any book from her pen may safely be guaranteed to fill many charmed
      and thoughtful hours. She is still a seeker of problems, and shares the
      faults of her school, inasmuch as she sets herself to the solution of
      themes which all thoughtful people have solved for themselves at an early
      age. It would be difficult, perhaps, to find a better and more salutary
      stimulant for the mind of a very young man or woman than &lsquo;Robert Elsmere,&rsquo; 
      to cite but one work of hers, but to the adult intelligence she seems a
      day behind the fair. She expends something very like genius in
      establishing a truth which is only doubted by here and there a narrow
      bigot&mdash;that truth being that a man may find himself forced to abandon
      the bare dogma of religion, and may yet conserve his faith in the Unseen
      and his spiritual brotherhood with men. &lsquo;Robert Elsmere&rsquo; is a very
      beautiful piece of work, and it is impossible not to respect the ardour
      which inspires it, and the many literary excellences by which it is
      distinguished. But, all the same, it leaves upon the mind a sense of some
      futility. It would be easy to write a story which would prove&mdash;if a
      story can be imagined to prove anything&mdash;the precise opposite of the
      truth so eloquently preached in &lsquo;Robert Elsmere,&rsquo; and the tale might be
      perfectly true to the experience of life. There are men who, parting with
      dogmatic religion, part with religion altogether, and whose only chance of
      salvation from themselves lies in the acceptance of a hard and fast creed.
      It would be easy enough, and true enough, to show such a man assailed by
      doubt, struggling and succumbing, and then going headlong to the devil.
      The thing has happened many a time. Mrs. Humphry Ward shows another kind
      of man, and depicts him most ably. Robert Elsmere is even a better
      Christian when he has surrendered his creed than he was whilst he held it,
      for he has reached to a loftier ideal of life, and he dies as a martyr to
      its duties. But the story has the air of being controversial, and fiction
      and controversy do not work well together. It is possible to establish any
      theory, so far as a single instance will do it, when you have the
      manufacture both of facts and of characters in your own hands. Accept an
      extreme case. A practised novelist might take in hand the character of a
      morose and surly fellow who was generous and expansive in his cups. So
      long as the wretch was sober he might be made hateful; half fill him with
      whisky, and you gift him with all manner of emotional good qualities. The
      study might be real enough, but it would prove nothing. The novelist who
      assails a controversial question begs everything, and the answer to a
      problem so posed is worthless except as the expression of an individual
      opinion. It may be urged&mdash;and there is force in the contention&mdash;that
      there are many people who are only induced to think of serious themes when
      they are dressed in the guise of fiction, as there are people who cannot
      take pills unless they are sugar-coated. Again&mdash;as admitted already&mdash;a
      mind in process of formation might be strengthened and broadened by the
      influence of such a book as &lsquo;Robert Elsmere.&rsquo; There are some to whom its
      apparent trend of thought will appear to be simply damnable. That one may
      have scant respect for their judgment, and no share at all in their
      opinion, does not alter the fact that the weapon employed against them is
      not and cannot be fairly used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many years ago, Mr. Clark Russell, whose name is now a household word, was
      the editor of an ill-fated society journal. I was a contributor to its
      little-read pages, and I came one day upon an article entitled &lsquo;Pompa
      Mortis.&rsquo; This article was written in such astonishingly good English, so
      clean, so hardbitten and terse, and yet so graceful, that I could not
      resist the temptation to ask its author&rsquo;s name. My editor modestly
      acknowledged it for his own, and when I told him what I thought of its
      style he confessed to a close study of Defoe and a great admiration for
      him. I saw nothing more from his hand until I read &lsquo;The Wreck of the
      Grosvenor,&rsquo; the first of that series of sea stories which has carried Mr.
      Russell&rsquo;s name about the world. An armchair voyage with Russell is almost
      as good as the real thing, and sometimes (as when the perils and
      distresses of shipwreck are in question) a great deal better. Had any man
      ever such an eye for the sea before, or such a power of bringing it to the
      sight of another? Few readers, I fancy, care a copper for his fable, or
      very much for his characters, except for the mere moment when they move in
      the page; but his descriptions of sky and sea linger in the mind like
      things actually seen. They are so sharp, so vivid, so detailed, so true,
      that a marine painter might work from them. And the really remarkable
      thing about them is the infinite variety of these seascapes and skyscapes.
      He seems never to repeat himself. He is various as the seas and skies he
      paints. One figures his mind as some sort of marvellous picture gallery.
      He veritably sees things, and he makes the reader see them. And all the
      strange and curious sea jargon, of which not one landsman in a thousand
      understands anything&mdash;combings and back-stays and dead-eyes, and the
      rest of it&mdash;takes a salt smack of romance in his lips. He can be as
      technical as he pleases, and the reader takes him on faith, and rollicks
      along with him, bewildered, possibly, but trusting and happy. And Clark
      Russell has not only been charming. He has been useful, too, and Foc&rsquo;sle
      Jack owes him a debt of gratitude. For though he does not shine as a
      draughtsman where the subtleties of character are concerned, he knows
      Jack, who is not much of a metaphysical puzzle, inside and out, and he has
      brought him home to us as no sea-writer ever tried to do before. Years ago
      it seemed natural to fancy that he might write himself out, but he goes on
      with a freshness which looks inexhaustible. If I cannot read him with the
      old enjoyment it is my misfortune and not his fault. If his latest book
      had been his first I should have found in it the charm which caught me
      years ago. But it is in the nature of things that an individual writer
      like Clark Russell should be his own most dangerous rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clark Russell is captain on his own deck, whether he sail a coffin or a
      princely Indiaman of the old time. Sir Walter Besant is lord of his own
      East End, and of that innocent seraglio of delightful and eccentric young
      ladies to which he has been adding for years past Sir Walter Besant is
      chiefly remarkable as an example of what may be done by a steadfast
      cheerfulness in style. His creed has always been that fiction is a
      recreative art, and we have no better sample of a manly and stout-hearted
      optimist than he. He is optimistic of set purpose, and sometimes his
      cheerfulness costs him a struggle, for he is tender-hearted and
      clear-sighted, and he is the Columbus of &lsquo;the great joyless city&rsquo; of the
      East. He has had a double aim&mdash;to keep his work recreative and to
      make it useful. In one respect he has been curiously happy, for he once
      dreamt aloud a beautiful dream, and has lived to find it a reality. It was
      his own bright hope which built the People&rsquo;s Palace, and a man might rest
      on that with ample satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has given us many well-studied types of character, but he excels in the
      portraiture of the manly young man and the lovable young woman. In this
      regard I find him at his apogee with Phyllis Fleming and Jack Dunquerque,
      who are both frankly alive and charming. He is good, too, at the
      portraiture of a humbug, and finds a humorous delight in him, very much as
      Dickens did. There is more than a touch of Dickens in his method, and in
      his way of seeing people, and, most of all, in the warm-hearted cheer he
      keeps.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is outside the purpose of this series to dwell on anything but the
      literary value of the works of the people dealt with; but little apology,
      after all, is needed for a side-glance at the work which Sir Walter Besant
      has done for men of letters. He has worked hard at the vexed and difficult
      question of copyright; he has founded an Authors&rsquo; Club and an authors&rsquo; 
      newspaper; and he has devoted with marked unselfishness much valuable time
      and effort to the general well-being of the craft. He has stood out
      stoutly for the State recognition of authorship, and in his own person he
      has received it. <i>Esprit de corps</i> is a capital thing in its way.
      Whether it is well to have too much of it in a body of men who hold the
      power of the Press largely in their own hands, whilst at the same time
      publicity is the breath of their nostrils, is perhaps an open question.
      But of Sir Walter Besant&rsquo;s single-mindedness in this voluntary work there
      is no shadow of doubt. Remembering his popularity with the public, and the
      price he can command for his work, it is evident that he has expended in
      the pursuit of his ideal time which would have been worth some thousands
      of pounds to him. He has striven in all ways to do honour to letters, and
      the esteem in which he is held is a just payment for high purpose and
      unselfish labour.

    <h2>
      XI.&mdash;MISS MARIE CORELLI
    </h2>
    <p>
      In an article intended for this series and set under this lady&rsquo;s name (an
      article now suppressed, and therefore to be re-written), I fell into an
      error which appears to have been shared by several of the critics who
      dealt with what was then the latest of her books, &lsquo;The Sorrows of Satan,&rsquo; 
      I assumed Miss Corelli to have drawn her own portrait, as she sees things,
      in the character of &lsquo;Mavis Clare.&rsquo; This belief has been expressed&mdash;so
      it turns out&mdash;by other people, and I learn that Miss Corelli has
      authoritatively denied it &lsquo;She objects very strongly,&rsquo; so says an inspired
      defender, &lsquo;to a notion which was started by one of the most distinguished
      of her interviewers, and absolutely denies the assertion that she
      described herself as &ldquo;Mavis Clare&rdquo; in &ldquo;The Sorrows of Satan.&rdquo;&rsquo; Miss
      Corelli, of course, knows the truth about this matter, and nobody else can
      possibly know it, but it is at least permissible to examine the evidence
      which led many separate people to the same false conclusion. &lsquo;Mavis Clare&rsquo; 
      and Marie Corelli own the same initials, and until the fact that this was
      a mere fortuitous chance was made clear by Miss Corelli herself it seemed
      natural to suppose that an identity was coyly hinted at. &lsquo;Mavis Clare&rsquo; is
      a novelist, and so is Miss Corelli. &lsquo;Mavis Clare&rsquo; is <i>mignonne</i> and
      fair, &lsquo;is pretty, and knows how to dress besides,&rsquo; is a &lsquo;most independent
      creature, too; quite indifferent to opinions,&rsquo; All these things, as we
      learn from many sources, are true of Miss Corelli also. It is said of Miss
      Corelli herself that &lsquo;dauntless courage, a clear head, and a tremendous
      power of working hard without hurting herself have helped her to make a
      successful use of her great gift. She is not afraid of anything. She
      &ldquo;insists on herself,&rdquo; and is unique,&rsquo; It is to be noted that all this is
      said by Miss Corelli of &lsquo;Mavis Clare,&rsquo; Miss Corelli is at war with the
      reviewers. So is &lsquo;Mavis Clare,&rsquo; Miss Corelli&rsquo;s books circulate by the
      thousand. So do &lsquo;Mavis Clare&rsquo;s.&rsquo; &lsquo;Mavis Clare&rsquo; is utterly indifferent to
      outside opinion. So is Miss Corelli. In point of fact, if anybody thought
      Miss Corelli a woman of astonishing genius, and wrote an honest account of
      her, he would describe her precisely as Miss Corelli has described &lsquo;Mavis
      Clare.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, in fact, a point up to which &lsquo;Mavis Clare&rsquo; and Miss Corelli are
      not to be separated. There are a score of things in any description of the
      one which are indubitably true of the other. But when Miss Corelli writes
      of &lsquo;Mavis Clare&rsquo; in such terms as are now to be quoted we begin to see
      that she is and must be indignant at the supposition that she is still
      writing of herself: &lsquo;She is too popular to need reviews. Besides, a large
      number of the critics&mdash;the &ldquo;log-rollers&rdquo; especially&mdash;are mad
      against her for her success, and the public know it. Clearness of thought,
      brilliancy of style, beauty of diction&mdash;all these are hers, united to
      consummate ease of expression and artistic skill. The potent, resistless,
      unpurchasable quality of Genius. She wrote what she had to say with a
      gracious charm, freedom, and innate consciousness of strength. She won
      fame without the aid of money, and was crowned so brightly and visibly
      before the world that she was beyond criticism.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But is it not just within the bounds of possibility that Miss Corelli
      began with some idea of depicting herself, and, discarding that idea, took
      too little care to obliterate resemblances? Even here she trenches too
      closely upon the truth to escape the calumnious supposition that she is
      writing of herself. She <i>is</i> too popular to need reviews. She is at
      war with the critics, and she has induced a very large portion of the
      public to believe that &lsquo;a number of the critics&mdash;the &ldquo;log-rollers&rdquo;
       especially&mdash;are mad against her for her success.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Were I, the present writer, to invent a fictional character, to give him
      for the initials of his name the letters D. C. M., to describe him as
      awkward and burly, with an untidy head of grey hair, to make him a
      novelist, a Bohemian and a wanderer, and then to paint him as a man of
      genius and an astonishing fine fellow, I should expect to be told that I
      had been guilty of a grave insolence. If I could honestly say that the
      resemblances had never struck me, and that the egregious vanity of the
      picture was a wholly imaginary thing, I should, of course, desire to be
      believed, and I should, of course, deserve to be believed. But I should
      encounter doubt, and I should not be disposed to wonder at it. If I were
      annoyed with anybody I should be annoyed with myself for having given such
      a handle to the world&rsquo;s ill-nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accepting Miss Corelli&rsquo;s disclaimer, one is still forced to the conclusion
      that she has fallen into a serious indiscretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In &lsquo;The Murder of Delicia&rsquo; we are made acquainted with another lady-writer
      who enjoys all the popularity of Miss Corelli and of &lsquo;Mavis Clare,&rsquo; who
      has the genius and the eyes and the stature and the hair of both. &lsquo;As a
      writer she stood quite apart from the rank and file of modern
      fictionists.&rsquo; &lsquo;The public responded to her voice, and clamoured for her
      work, and as a natural result of this, all ambitious and aspiring
      publishers were her very humble suppliants. Whatsoever munificent and
      glittering terms are dreamed of by authors in their wildest conceptions of
      a literary El Dorado were hers to command; and yet she was neither vain
      nor greedy.&rsquo; One thanks God piously that yet she was neither vain nor
      greedy; but one can&rsquo;t keep the mouth from watering. Ah! those wildest
      conceptions of a literary El Dorado! &lsquo;Delicia&rsquo; gets 8,000L. for a book.
      May it be delicately hinted that this sum is only approached in the
      receipts of one living lady-writer, and that the lady-writer&rsquo;s name is
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;? Wild horses shall not drag this pen further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Corelli complains, in a preface to this recent work, that &lsquo;every
      little halfpenny ragamuffin of the press that can get a newspaper corner
      in which to hide himself for the convenience of throwing stones,&rsquo; pelts
      every &lsquo;brilliant woman&rsquo; with the word &lsquo;unsexed.&rsquo; Honestly, I don&rsquo;t
      remember the reproach being hurled at Mrs. Browning, or George Eliot, or
      Mrs. Cowden Clarke, or Charlotte Brontë, or Maria Edgeworth, or Mrs.
      Hemans. Miss Corelli tells us that the woman who is &lsquo;well-nigh stripped to
      man&rsquo;s gaze every night,&rsquo; and who &lsquo;drinks too much wine and brandy,&rsquo; is not
      subjected to this reproach, whilst if another woman &lsquo;prefers to keep her
      woman&rsquo;s modesty, and execute some great work of art which shall be as good
      or even better than anything man can accomplish, she will be dubbed
      &ldquo;unsexed&rdquo; instantly,&rsquo; Where has Miss Corelli found the society of which
      these amazing things are true? Does anybody else know it? And where are
      the better works of art from woman&rsquo;s hand than man can accomplish? &lsquo;Aurora
      Leigh&rsquo; and the Portuguese Sonnets are at the top of feminine achievement,
      and Shakespeare is not dethroned. And here is a pearl of common sense: &lsquo;To
      put it bluntly and plainly, a great majority of the men of the present day
      want women to keep them,&rsquo; This is Miss Corelli in her own person in her
      preface, and, &lsquo;to put it bluntly and plainly,&rsquo; the statement is not true,
      or approximately true, or within shouting distance of the truth. And what
      of the &lsquo;persons of high distinction who always find something curiously
      degrading in paying their tradesmen&rsquo;? Are they commoner than persons of
      high distinction who meet their bills? Are they as common? Miss Corelli
      sweeps the board. She is angry because some people will not take her
      seriously, but whilst her pages are charged with this kind of matter, she
      cannot fairly blame anybody but herself. She burns to be a social
      reformer. It would be unjust to deny her ardour. But when she tells the
      tale of a penniless nobleman who lives on his wife&rsquo;s money and breaks her
      heart, and assures us that &lsquo;there are thousands of such cases every day,&rsquo; 
      she undoes her own sermon by one rampant phrase of nonsense There are such
      men, more&rsquo;s the pity, and they are the social satirist&rsquo;s honest game There
      have been foolish people who thought that women unsexed themselves by
      doing artistic work, but they died many years ago, for the most part.
      There are men who want to marry rich women, and live lazy lives, but they
      are not &lsquo;a great majority.&rsquo; Miss Corelli knows these things, of course,
      for they are patent to the world; but she allows zeal to run away with
      judgment. The rules for satire are the rules for Irish stew. You mustn&rsquo;t
      <i>empty</i> the pepper-castor, and the pot should be kept at a gentle
      bubble only. There is reason in the profitable denunciation of a wicked
      world, as well as in the roasting of eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Corelli has hit the public hard, and it is the self-imposed task
      of the present writer to find out, as far as in him lies, why and how she
      has done this. Miss Corelli&rsquo;s force is hysteric, but it is sometimes very
      real. A self-approving hysteria can do fine things under given conditions.
      It has been the motive power in some work which the world has rightly
      accepted as great. In the execution of certain forms of emotional art it
      is a positive essential. Much genuine poetry has been produced under its
      influence. It is a sort of spiritual wind, which, rushing through the
      harp-strings of the soul, may make an extraordinary music. But the sounds
      produced depend not upon the impulse conveyed to the instrument, but on
      the quality and condition of the instrument itself. Without the impulse a
      large and various mind may lie quiescent. With the impulse a small and
      disordered spirit may make a very considerable sound. In the very loftiest
      flights of genius we discern a sort of glorious dementia. All readers have
      found it in the last splendid verse of &lsquo;Adonaïs.&rsquo; It proclaims itself in
      Keats in the wild <i>naïveté</i> of the inquiry, &lsquo;Muse of my native land,
      am I inspired?&rsquo; The faculty of the very greatest among the great lies in
      the existence of this inrush of emotion, in strict subordination to the
      intellectual powers. To be without it precludes greatness; to be wholly
      subject to its influence is to be insane. Miss Corelli experiences the
      inrush of emotion in great force, but, unfortunately for her work, and for
      herself, the sense of power which it inspires is not co-ordinate with the
      strength of intellect which is essential to its control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Corelli has ventured freely into the domain of spiritual things, and
      has dealt, with more daring than knowledge, with esoteric mysteries. The
      great reading public knows little of these matters, because, as a rule,
      they have been expressed by writers whose works are too abstruse to catch
      the popular ear. It is only when they are handled by writers of
      imaginative fiction that they become popularly known at all. In &lsquo;The
      Sorrows of Satan&rsquo; Miss Corelli has earned a reputation for originality by
      advancing a theory which is older than many of the hills. It has been for
      ages a rooted religious belief, but it is wholly in conflict with the
      theological ideas which are taught in our churches and chapels, and has,
      therefore, a startling air of strangeness to the average church and
      chapel-goer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theory is thus expressed in Mr. C. G. Harrison&rsquo;s lectures on &lsquo;The
      Transcendental Universe&rsquo;: &lsquo;It is generally supposed that Satan is the
      enemy of spirituality in man; that he delights in his degradation, and
      views with diabolical satisfaction the development of his lower nature and
      all its evil consequences. The wide, and almost universal, prevalence of
      this mediaeval superstition only makes it all the more necessary to
      protest against it as a grotesque error.... It would probably be much
      nearer the truth to say that the degradation and suffering of mankind, for
      which the adversary of God is responsible, so far from affording him any
      satisfaction, afflict him with a sense of failure and deepen his despair
      of ultimate victory.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is, of course, the root idea of &lsquo;The Sorrows of Satan,&rsquo; and if the
      theme had been handled with reserve and dignity a very noble book indeed
      might without doubt have been built upon it. But Miss Corelli has not had
      the power to confine herself within the limits of the severe and lofty
      conception of the old Theosophists. Her sorrowful Satan grows first
      melodramatic and then absurd. The notion that the great sad adversary of
      Almighty Goodness is settled in a modern London hotel, with a private cook
      of his own, and a privately engaged bath of his own, carries the reader
      away from the original conception to the burlesque&mdash;vulgar and
      flagrant&mdash;of the mystery-plays of the Middle Ages; and the devotion
      of supernatural power to the preparations for a suburban garden-party is
      purely ludicrous. Miss Corelli has seized the Theosophic thought, which in
      itself is far nobler and more poetic than the Miltonic, but she has not
      been strong enough to use it. She has fallen under the weight of her
      chosen theme, and the result is that her demoniac hero is at one time
      presented as a majestic and suffering spirit, and at another as a mere
      Merry Andrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curious and instructive part of all this is that, if Miss Corelli had
      been gifted with any power of self-criticism, her ardour would have been
      damped, and any work she might have done would have suffered
      proportionately. Her work has hit the public hard, and it has done so
      because, of its kind, her inspiration has been genuine. The wind does not
      blow through the strings of a well-ordered instrument, but <i>it blows</i>,
      and however grotesque the sound produced may sometimes be, it is of a sort
      which is not to be produced by any mere mechanism of the mind. To the
      critical ear the tunes played in &lsquo;Wormwood&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Sorrows of Satan&rsquo; are
      not, and cannot be, agreeable. The writer, to speak in plain English, and
      without the obscurity of symbols, is the owner of genius on the emotional
      side, and is not the owner of genius, or anything approaching to it, even
      from afar, on the intellectual side. The result of this disproportion
      between impulse and power is, to the critical mind, disastrous; but it
      does not so make itself felt with the ordinary reader. It is rather an
      unusual thing with him to come into contact with a real force in books. He
      has not read or thought enough to know that the ideas offered to him with
      such transcendental pomp are old and commonplace. It is enough for him to
      feel that the writer understands herself to be a personage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She succeeds in imposing herself upon the public because she has first
      been convinced of her own authority. Her inward conviction of the
      authority of her own message and her own power to deliver it is the one
      qualification which makes her different from the mob of writing ladies.
      Even when she deals with purely social themes the same air of overwhelming
      earnestness sits upon her brow. In a little trifle published in the
      November of 1896, and entitled &lsquo;Jane,&rsquo; she goes to work with a quite
      prophetic ardour to tell a story almost identical with that related in a
      scrap of Thackeray&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cox&rsquo;s Diary.&rsquo; The reader may find the tale in the
      second chapter of that brief work, where it is headed &lsquo;First Rout.&rsquo; 
      Thackeray tells his version of it with a sense of fun and humour. Miss
      Corelli tells hers with the voice and manner of a Boanerges.. Nothing is
      to be done without the divine afflatus, and plenty of it. The
      temperamental difference between the satirist and the scold is well
      illustrated by a large handling and a little handling of the same theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point upon which it seems worth while to insist is this: That the mass
      of the reading public is always ready to submit itself to the influence of
      sincerity. It does not seem much to matter what inner characteristics the
      sincerity may have. In the case now under analysis the quality seems to
      resolve itself into pure self-confidence. Miss Corelli&rsquo;s method of
      capturing the public mind is not a trick which anybody else might copy. It
      is the result of a real, though perilous, gift of nature&mdash;a gift
      which she possesses in something of a superlative degree. Nobody could
      pretend to such a gift and succeed by virtue of the pretence. Miss Corelli
      is, at least, quite serious in the belief that she is a woman of genius.
      She is only very faintly touched with doubt when she thinks that the
      people who are laughing at her are writhing with envy. She speaks,
      therefore, with precisely that air of authority to which she would have a
      right if her ideas with regard to her own mental power were based on solid
      fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far we arrive at little more than the long-established truth that the
      unthinking portion of the public is not only longing for a moral guide,
      but is ready to accept anybody who is conscious of authority. It would be
      well if we could leave Miss Corelli here, but something remains to be said
      which is not altogether pleasant to say. In &lsquo;The Sorrows of Satan&rsquo; many
      pages are devoted to the bitter (and merited) abuse of certain female
      writers who deal coarsely with the sexual problem. But Miss Corelli
      appears to think that she may be as frankly disagreeable as she pleases so
      long as she is conscious of a moral purpose. Whatever she may feel, and
      whatever estimable purposes may guide her, she has published many things
      which run side by side with her denunciation of her sister writers, and
      are as offensive as anything to be found in the work of any living woman.
      Take as a solitary example the following passage:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I soon found that Lucio did not intend to marry, and I concluded that he
      preferred to be the lover of many women, instead of the husband of one. I
      did not love him any the less for this; I only resolved that I would at
      least be one of those who were happy enough to share his passion. I
      married the man Tempest, feeling that, like many women I knew, I should,
      when safely wedded, have greater liberty of action. I was aware that most
      modern men prefer an amour with a married woman to any other kind of <i>liaison</i>,
      and I thought Lucio would have readily yielded to the plan I had
      preconceived.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know of any passage in any of the works so savagely assaulted by
      Miss Corelli which goes beyond this; and I think it the more, and not the
      less, objectionable, because the lady who wrote it can see so very plainly
      how sinful her offence is when it is committed by other people.

    <h2>
      XII.&mdash;THE AMERICANS
    </h2>
    <p>
      I suppose it will not be disputed that the glory of a nation&rsquo;s literature
      lies in the fact that it is national&mdash;that it reflects truly the
      spirit and the life of the people with whom it is concerned, by whom it is
      written, and to whom it belongs. It will not be denied either that this
      final splendour has not yet descended on the literature of America. The
      happy and tonic optimism of Emerson is a gift which could hardly have been
      bestowed upon any man in an old country. It belongs to a land and a time
      of boundless aspiration and of untired youth, and in virtue of this
      possession Emerson is amongst the most characteristically American of
      Americans. In the walks of fiction, with which alone we have to deal in
      these pages, the Americans have been distinctively English in spirit and
      in method (until within recent years), even when they have dealt with
      themes chosen from their own surroundings. There is nowhere in the world,
      and never was until now, and possibly never again will be, such another
      field for the born student of human nature as is afforded by the United
      States at this time. The world has never seen such an intimate mixture of
      racial elements as may be found there. A glance at the Newspaper Directory
      shows the variety and extent of the foreign elements which, though in
      rapid process of absorption, are as yet undigested. Hundreds on hundreds
      on hundreds of journals minister to the daily and weekly needs of Germans,
      Frenchmen, Italians, Norwegians, Swedes, Russians, Hungarians. There are
      Polish newspapers, and Armenian, and Hebrew, and Erse and Gaelic. Sleepy
      old Spain is rubbing shoulders with the eager and energetic races of Maine
      and New York and Massachusetts. The negro element is everywhere, and the
      Chinese add a flavour of their own to the <i>olla podrida</i>. So far no
      American writers of fiction have seen America in the large. Bits of it
      have been presented with an admirable art; but as yet the continent awaits
      its Dickens, its Balzac, its Shakespeare, or its Zola.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bret Harte has made California his own, but it is not the California
      of to-day. &lsquo;Gone is that camp, and wasted all its fire,&rsquo; but the old life
      lives in some of its pages still, and will find students for a long time
      to come. He has given us three, perhaps, of the best short stories in the
      world, and a man who has done so much has a right to gratitude and
      goodwill. Possibly there never was a writer who gave the world all the
      essentials personal to his art so early, and yet so long survived in the
      race for popularity. Bret Harte&rsquo;s first book was something like a
      revelation. In workmanship he reminds the reader of Dickens, but his
      surroundings were wholly novel, and as delightful as they were strange. He
      bewitched the whole reading world with &lsquo;The Luck of Roaring Camp,&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;The Outcasts of Poker Flat,&rsquo; and ever since those days he has gone on
      with a tireless vivacity, telling the same stories over and over again,
      showing us the same scenes and the same people with an apparent
      unconsciousness of the fact of repetition which is truly astonishing. The
      roads of dusty red and the scented pine groves come back in story after
      story, and Colonel Starbottle and Jack Folinsbee look like immortals. The
      vagabond with the melodious voice who did something virtuous and went away
      warbling into the night is alive in new as in old pages, in defiance of
      fatigue. Preternaturally murderous gamblers with a Quixotic eye to the
      point of honour, saintly blackguards with superhuman splendours of
      affection and loyalty revealed in the final paragraph of their history, go
      on and on in his pages with changeless aspect. The oddest mixture of
      staleness and of freshness is to be found there. Since he first delighted
      us he has scarcely troubled himself once to find a new story, or a new
      type of character, or a new field for his descriptive powers. He took the
      Spanish mission into his stock-in-trade, and he has since made that as
      hackneyed as the rest. And yet there remains this peculiarity about him&mdash;his
      latest stories, are pretty nearly as good as his first. It would seem as
      if his interest had not flagged, as if the early impressions which
      impelled him to write were still clear and urgent in his mind. He is
      amongst the most singular of modern literary phenomena. The zest with
      which he has told the same tale for so many years sets him apart. It is as
      if until the age, say, of thirty he had been gifted with a brilliant
      faculty of observation, and had then suddenly ceased to observe at all.
      There seems to have come a time when his musical box would hold no more
      tunes, and ever since then he has gone on repeating the old ones. The
      oddness is not so much in the repetition as in the air of enjoyment and
      spontaneity worn by the grinder. He at least is not fatigued, and to
      readers who live from hand to mouth, and have no memories, there is no
      reason why he should ever grow fatiguing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Henry James is a gentleman who has taken a little more culture than is
      good for the fibre of his character. He is certainly a man of many
      attainments and of very considerable native faculty, but he staggers under
      the weight of his own excellences. The weakness is common enough in
      itself, but it is not common in combination with such powers as Mr. James
      possesses. He is vastly the superior of the common run of men, but he
      makes his own knowledge of that fact too clear. It is a little difficult
      to see why so worshipful a person should take the trouble to write at all,
      but it is open to the reader to conjecture that he would not be at so much
      pains unless he were pushed by a compulsory sense of his own high merits.
      He feels that it would be a shame if such a man should be wasted. I cannot
      say that I have ever received; from him any supreme enlightenment as to
      the workings of that complex organ, the human heart, but I understand
      quite definitely that Mr. James knows all about it, and could show many
      things if he were only interested enough to make an effort He is the
      apostle of a well-bred boredom. He knows all about society, and <i>bric-à-brac</i>,
      and pictures, and music, and natural landscape, and foreign cities, and if
      he could feel a spice of interest in any earthly thing he could be
      charming. But his listless, easy air&mdash;of gentlemanly-giftedness
      fatigued&mdash;provokes and bores. He is like a man who suppresses a yawn
      to tell a story. He is a blend of genuine power and native priggery, and
      his faults are the more annoying because of the virtues they obscure and
      spoil. He is big enough to know better.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is likely enough that to Mr. James the fact of having been bred in the
      United States has proved a disadvantage. To the robuster type of man of
      letters, to the Dickens or Kipling kind of man, it would be impossible to
      wish better luck than to be born into that bubbling pot-full of things.
      But Mr. James&rsquo;s over-accentuated refinement of mind has received the very
      impetus of which it stood least in need. He has grown into a humorous
      disdain of vulgar emotions, partly because he found them so rich about
      him. The figures which Bret Harte sees through a haze of romance are to
      him essentially coarse. The thought of Mr. James in association with
      Tennessee and Partner over a board supplied with hog, flapjack and
      forty-rod awakes a bewildering pity in the mind. An hour of Colonel
      Starbottle would soil him for a week. He is not made for such contact. It
      is both curious and instructive to notice how the too-cultured
      sensitiveness of a man of genius has blinded him to the greatest truth in
      the human life about him. Born into the one country where romance is still
      a constant factor in the lives of men, he conceives romance to be dead.
      With stories worthy of a great writer&rsquo;s handling transacting themselves on
      every hand, he is the first elucidator of the principle that a
      story-teller&rsquo;s business is to have no story. The vision of the sheet which
      was let down from Heaven to Peter was seen in vain so far as he is
      concerned, but the story of that dream holds an eternal truth for the real
      artist. Mr. James is not the only man whose best-nursed and most valued
      part has proved to be destructive With a little more strength he might
      have kept all his delicacies, and have been a man to thank God for. As it
      is, he is the victim of an intellectual foppery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. W. D. Howells has something in common with Mr. James, but he is of
      stronger stuff&mdash;not less essentially a gentleman, as his books reveal
      him, but more essentially a man. He has a sterling courage, and has never
      been afraid of his own opinions. His declaration that &lsquo;all the stories
      have been told&rsquo; is one of the keys to his method as a novelist A work of
      fiction is something which enables him to show the impingement of
      character on character, with modifying effects of environment and
      circumstance. His style is clean and sober, and his method is invariably
      dignified. He has deliberately allowed his critical prepossessions to
      exclude him from all chance of greatness, but within his self-set limits
      he moves with a certain serene mastery, and his detail is finely accurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mary Wilkins, who is a very much younger writer than any of the three
      here dealt with, reminds an English reader both of George Eliot and Miss
      Mitford. &lsquo;Pembroke&rsquo; is the best and completest of her books. So far as
      pure literary charm goes it would be difficult to amend her work, but the
      suggestion of character conveyed is surely too acidulated. Such a set of
      stubborn, self-willed, and uncomfortable people as are gathered together
      in these pages could hardly have lived in any single village in any
      quarter of the world. They are drawn with an air of truth which is not
      easy to resist, but if they are really as accurately studied as they seem
      to be Pembroke must be a place to fly from. It is conceivable that the
      members of such a congregation might be less intolerable to each other
      than they seem to the foreign outsider, but the ameliorating effects of
      usage must needs be strong indeed to make them fit to live with. For the
      most part they are represented as well-meaning folk; but they are
      exasperatingly individual, all over sore corners, eager to be injured at
      their tenderest points, and implacable to the person who hurts them. In
      Pembroke a soreness of egotism afflicts everybody. Every creature in the
      book is over-sensitive to slight and misunderstanding, and every creature
      is clumsy and careless in the infliction of pain. It is a study in
      self-centred egotism. People who have an opportunity of knowing village
      life in the Eastern States proclaim the book a masterpiece of observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bret Harte, studying a form of life now extinct, which once (with certain
      allowances made for the romantic tendency) flourished in the West; Mr.
      Howells, taking micro-graphic studies of present-day life in the great
      centre of American culture; Mr. James, with a clever, weary <i>persiflage</i>
      skimming the face of society in refined cosmopolitan circles; and Miss
      Wilkins, observing the bitter humours of the Eastern yokel, are none of
      them distinctively American either in feeling or expression. Mr. Samuel L.
      Clemens&mdash;otherwise Mark Twain&mdash;stands in striking contrast to
      them all. He is not an artist in the sense in which the others are
      artists, but he is beyond compare the most distinct and individual of
      contemporary American writers. He started as a mere professional
      fun-maker, and he has not done with fun-making even yet, but he has
      developed in the course of years into a rough and ready philosopher, and
      he has written two books which are in their own way unique. Tom Sawyer and
      Huck Finn are the two best boys in the whole wide range of fiction, the
      most natural, genuine, and convincing. They belong to their own soil, and
      could have been born and bred nowhere else, but they are no truer locally
      than universally. Mark Twain can be eloquent when the fancy takes him, but
      the medium he employs is the simplest and plainest American English. He
      thinks like an American, feels like an American, is American blood and
      bones, heart and head. He is not the exponent of culture, but more than
      any man of his own day, excepting Walt Whitman, he expresses the sterling,
      fearless, manly side of a great democracy. Taking it in the main, it is
      admirable, and even lovable, as he displays it. It has no reverence for
      things which in themselves are not reverend, and since its point of view
      is not one from which all things are visible it seems occasionally
      overbold and crude; but the creed it expresses is manly, and clean, and
      wholesome, and the man who lives by it is a man to be admired. The point
      of view may be higher in course of time, and the observer&rsquo;s horizon
      widened. The limitations of the mind which adopts the present standpoint
      may be found in &lsquo;A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur.&rsquo; Apart from its
      ethics, the book is a mistake, for a jest which could have been elaborated
      to tedium in a score of pages is stretched to spread through a bulky
      volume, and snaps into pieces under that tension.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great war of North and South has been answerable for more fiction than
      any other campaign of any age, and it has quite recently furnished reason
      for the novel, &lsquo;The Red Badge of Courage,&rsquo; by Mr. Stephen Crane, which is
      out of counting the truest picture of the sort the world has seen. It
      seemed at first impossible to believe that it had been written by any but
      a veteran. It turns out that the author is quite a young man, and that he
      gathered everything by reading and by hearsay. Here again the method is
      national and characteristic. After all these years of natural submission
      to British influence American writers are growing racy of their own soil.

      XIII.&mdash;THE YOUNG ROMANCERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the combined spelling and reading book which was in use in schools more
      than forty years ago there was printed a story to the following effect:&mdash;Certain
      Arabs had lost a camel, and in the course of their wanderings in search of
      him they met a dervish, whom they questioned. The dervish answered by
      offering questions on his own side. &lsquo;Was your camel lame in one foot?&rsquo; he
      began. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the owners. &lsquo;Was he blind in one eye?&rsquo; he continued.
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the owners again. &lsquo;Had he lost a front tooth?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; &lsquo;Was he
      laden with corn on one side and with honey on the other?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, yes, yes.
      This is our camel. Where have you seen him?&rsquo; The dervish answered: &lsquo;I have
      never seen him.&rsquo; The Arabs, not without apparent reason, suspected the
      dervish of playing with them, and were about to chastise him, when the
      holy man asked for a hearing. Having secured it, he explained. He had seen
      the track of the camel. He had known the animal to be lame of one foot
      because that foot left a slighter impression than the others upon the dust
      of the road. He had argued it blind of one eye because it had cropped the
      herbage on one side of the road alone. He knew it to have lost a tooth
      because of the gap left in the centre of its bite. Bees and flies argued
      honey on one side of the beast, and ants carrying wheat grains argued
      wheat on the other. The name of this observant and synthetic-minded
      dervish was not Sherlock Holmes, but he had the method of that famous
      detective, and in a sense anticipated the plots of all the stories which
      Dr. Conan Doyle has so effectively related of him. Possibly the best
      stories in the world which depend for their interest on this kind of
      induction are Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s. &lsquo;The Gold Bug,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Murder in the Rue
      Morgue,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Stolen Letter&rsquo; have not been surpassed or even equalled
      by any later writer; but Dr. Doyle comes in an excellent second, and if he
      has not actually rivalled Poe in the construction and development of any
      single story, he has run him close even there, and has beaten him in the
      sustained ingenuity of continuous invention; The story of &lsquo;The Speckled
      Band&rsquo; has a flavour almost as gruesome and terrible as Poe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Black Cat,&rsquo; 
      and an unusual faculty for dramatic narrative is displayed throughout the
      whole clever series. The Sherlock Holmes stories are far, indeed, from
      being Dr. Doyle&rsquo;s best work, but it is to them that he mainly owes his
      popularity. They took the imaginative side of the general reader, and
      their popular properties are likely to keep them before the public mind
      for a long while to come. To estimate Dr. Doyle&rsquo;s position as a writer one
      has to meet him in &lsquo;The Refugees,&rsquo; in &lsquo;The White Company,&rsquo; and in &lsquo;Rodney
      Stone.&rsquo; In each of these there is evident a sound and painstaking method
      of research, as well as a power of dramatic invention; and in combination
      with these is a style of unaffected manliness, simplicity, and strength,
      which is at once satisfactory to the student and attractive to the mass of
      people who are content to be pleased by such qualities without knowing or
      asking why. The labour bestowed on &lsquo;The White Company&rsquo; may very well be
      compared to that expended by Charles Reade on &lsquo;The Cloister and the H
      earth.&rsquo; It covers a far less extent of ground than that monumental
      romance, and it has not (and does not aim at) its universality of mood,
      but the same desire of accuracy, the same order of scholarship, the same
      industry, the same sense of scrupulous honour in matters of ascertainable
      fact, are to be noted, and being noted, are worthy of unstinted
      admiration. It is, perhaps, an open question as to whether Dr. Doyle, in
      his latest book, has not run a little ahead of the time at which a story
      on such a theme could be written with entire safety. &lsquo;Rodney Stone&rsquo; is a
      story of the prize-ring, and of the gambling, hard-drinking, and somewhat
      brutalised days in which that institution flourished There are many of us
      (I have made public confession half a score of times) who regret the
      abolition of the ring, on grounds of public policy. We argue that man is a
      fighting animal, and that in the days of the ring there was a recognised
      code of rules which regulated his conduct at times when the combative
      instinct was not to be restrained. We observe that our commonalty now use
      the knife in quarrel, and we regret the death of that rough principle of
      honour which once imposed itself upon the worst of rowdies. But there is
      little doubt that the feeling of the community at large is overwhelmingly
      against us, and it is for this reason that I am dubious as to the success
      of Dr. Doyle&rsquo;s last literary venture. The makings of romance are in the
      story, and are well used. There are episodes of excellent excitement in
      it; notable amongst these being the race on the Godstone Road, which is
      done with a swing and passion not easy to overpraise. In the narrative of
      the fight and of the incidents which preceded it the feeling of the time
      is admirably preserved, and the interest of the reader is held at an
      unyielding tension. But the prize-ring is a little too near as yet to
      offer unimpeachable matter for romance; and people who can read of the
      bloodthirsty Umslopogaas and his semi-comic holocausts with an unshaken
      stomach, or feel a placid historic pleasure in the chronicles of Nero&rsquo;s
      eccentricities, will find &lsquo;Rodney Stone&rsquo; objectionable because it
      chronicles a &lsquo;knuckle fight,&rsquo; and because a &lsquo;knuckle fight&rsquo; is still
      occasionally brought off in London, and more occasionally suppressed by
      the police.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a more serious criticism awaits Dr. Conan Doyle&rsquo;s last work. It is
      offered respectfully, and with every admiration for the high qualities
      already noticed. In the re-embodiment of a bygone age in fiction, three
      separate and special faculties are to be exercised. The first is the
      faculty for research, which must expend its energy not merely on the theme
      in hand, but on the age at large. The second is the imaginative and
      sympathetic faculty, which alone can make the dry bones of social history
      live again. The third is the faculty of self-repression, the power to cast
      away all which, however laboriously acquired, is dramatically unessential.
      Two of these powers belong in generous measure to Dr. Conan Doyle. The
      third, which is as necessary to complete success, he has not yet
      displayed. In &lsquo;Rodney Stone&rsquo; an attempt has been made to cover up this
      shortcoming, in the form in which the story has been cast, and in the very
      choice of its title. But when the book comes to be read it is not the tale
      of Rodney Stone (who is a mere outsider privileged to narrate), but of his
      fashionable uncle&rsquo;s combat with Sir Lothian Hume, with the ring in which
      their separate champions appear as a battle ground. Many pages are crowded
      with people who are named in passing and forgotten. They have no influence
      on the narrative, and no place in it. Their presence assuredly displays a
      knowledge of the time and its chronicles, but they are just so many
      obstacles to the clear run of the story, and no more. This is the chief
      fault to be found with the book, but it is a grave fault, and the writer,
      if he is to take the place which his powers and his industry alike join in
      claiming for him, must learn to cast &lsquo;as rubbish to the void&rsquo; many a
      painfully acquired bit of knowledge. To be an antiquary is one thing, and
      to be an antiquarian romancer is another. Dr. Doyle has aimed at being
      both one and the other in the same pages. A true analogy may be taken from
      the stage, where the supernumeraries are not allowed to obscure the
      leading lady and gentleman at any moment of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stanley Weyman, who is not Dr. Doyle&rsquo;s equal in other matters, is in
      this sole respect his master. He keeps his hero on the scene, and his
      action in full swing. He gives no indication of a profound or studious
      knowledge of his time, but he knows it fairly well. Mr. Doyle&rsquo;s method is
      at bottom the truer, when once the detailed labour is hidden, but when it
      bares its own machinery it loses most of its gain. Mr. Weyman tells a
      rattling story in rattling fashion. His is the good old style of
      easy-going romance, where courage and adventure never fail. He has chosen
      the realm of D&rsquo;Artagnan and Aramis, of Porthos and Athos, and he has
      plenty of vivacity, and can invent brilliantly on the lines on which the
      brave Dumas invented long before him. He is a cheerful and inspiriting
      echo. He cannot wind the mighty horn the elders sounded, but he can
      imitate it fairly from a distance. It is only when that crass reviewer
      comes along to tell us that the old original hunter of romance is back
      again that his music gives us anything but pleasure. For my own part, I
      hope he may flourish long, and give us stories as good as &lsquo;A Gentleman of
      France&rsquo; as often as he can. My &lsquo;Bravo!&rsquo; shall be as ready as any man&rsquo;s and
      as hearty. Why&mdash;to change the simile used just now&mdash;when a man
      is resting his legs in a comfortable <i>auberge</i>, and drinking the
      honest light wine of the country (which doesn&rsquo;t pretend to be better than
      it is), should the asinine enthusiast come to spoil his enjoyment by
      swearing that he sits in the enchanted palace of Sir Walter, and has
      before him the mighty wine Sir Walter bottled? The enthusiast provokes to
      wrath. It&rsquo;s a very good <i>duberge</i>&mdash;it&rsquo;s a capital, comfortable
      house of call, and we should like to sit there often. And the wine&mdash;we
      found no fault with the wine. It&rsquo;s an honest tap, and a wholesome and a
      palatable, and here&rsquo;s the landlord&rsquo;s health in it. But the magic vintage?
      Rubbish!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Anthony Hope has been so lucky as to please the public in two styles.
      In the one <i>genre</i> he has displayed an undoubted capacity, marred
      here and there to some tastes by a not very defined seeming of
      superciliousness, and in the other he has taken us into the most agreeable
      regions of unrestrained romance in which English readers have had leave to
      wander this many a day. He has caught the very tone of simple-hearted
      sincerity in which his later stories demand to be told. As an example of
      the adaptation of literary method to the exigencies of narrative it would
      not be easy to light on anything better. It is a little surprising that
      the trivial story and the trivial style of &lsquo;Mr. De Witt&rsquo;s Widow&rsquo; should
      have come from the hand which gave us the histories of the Princess Osra,
      and created the Kingdom of Ruritania. The one kind of work is clever, and
      smart, and knowingly&mdash;rather pretentiously&mdash;man-of-the-worldish.
      The other is large and simple, sweet and credulous. Mr. Hope, from his
      latest pages, has breathed on a tired and jaded time the breath of a pure
      and harmless fancy, and has earned its thanks for that benefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been seen that the art of fiction as practised at this hour
      includes almost all known forms of romance, and that no school may be said
      to have its own way to the exclusion of another. It has been seen, too,
      that though this is not a day of pre-eminent greatness, we can boast an
      astonishing industry and fertility. The output of literary work has never
      been so large, nor has the average of excellence ever been so equal or so
      high. It has been demonstrated&mdash;it is being demonstrated in new
      instances two or three times a year&mdash;that literary talent is not at
      all the uncommon and half-miraculous thing it was once supposed to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genius is as rare as ever, and is likely to continue so, but talent
      multiplies its appearances in full accordance with economic rules. No age
      ever submitted so constantly as ours to be amused or soothed by the
      romancer&rsquo;s art. The permission has opened the door to a great number of
      capable, industrious, and workmanlike men and women, who have learnt their
      business of amusement well. To the vast majority of us literature is as
      much a trade as any of the accepted businesses of Holborn or Cheapside,
      and, apart from a lingering sentimentalism, there is no reason why the
      fact should not be owned. There is no shame in honest craftwork done for
      hire, and when the work is so excellent as at least a score of living
      English writers can make it, we have a right to take Some pride in it But
      with this day&rsquo;s newspaper before me I learn that Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      who is the thin mimic of a fine imitator, has surpassed his last
      &lsquo;masterpiece,&rsquo; and that a lady of name to me unknown has &lsquo;rivalled&rsquo; his
      masterpiece, and that a gentleman to me unknown has produced a book which
      must necessarily be a &lsquo;classic.&rsquo; A masterpiece is a rare thing, and words
      have a definite meaning. We call &lsquo;Vanity Fair&rsquo; and &lsquo;Esmond&rsquo; masterpieces,
      when we desire to be enthusiastic. We call &lsquo;David Copperfield&rsquo; a
      masterpiece, and we find plenty of people to dispute the judgment. A
      masterpiece is the master work of a master hand. It must needs be a rare
      thing. It is not for the dignity of our work that it should be greeted by
      that sort of hysteric hiccoughing against which these pages have
      protested. It is a shameless insult to letters at large when the hysteria
      is bought and paid for, as does sometimes happen, and not less insulting
      when the gentleman who grinds the axe is fee&rsquo;d in kind by the other
      gentleman who rolls the log.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, what is done is done, and I leave my task with some misgiving. If
      here and there I have given pain, I have not written a word in malice. The
      pleasantest part of my work has lain in the fact that with every desire to
      be honest I have so often been compelled to praise.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
